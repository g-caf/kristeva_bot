"And begin at my sanctuary!"" Ezekiel, 9:4-6 The sages have said ""Do not read 'begin at my sanctuary,' but 'begin with those that sanctify me/...as teaches the Talmudic Treatise Sabbath, 55a.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Commentary of Rachi on Ezekiel 9:6...""That is my place in the sun."" That is how the usurpation of the whole world began.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The sheer originality and range of Levinas's thought demand nothing less than a fundamental reorientation of Western spirit —philosophy, logic, rhetoric, praxis, ontology, science, art, politics, religion — in the light of morality and justice.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
A striking continuity links Levinas's writings.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"At their heart lies the irreducible ethical proximity of one human being to another, morality, and through that encounter a relation to all others, justice.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Each successive text branches out, filigrees, presents successively richer, fuller, more nuanced analyses, testifying to the cornucopian genius of Levinas's central ethical vision.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"A sentence becomes a section, which in turns expands into an entire chapter.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Otherwise than Being and Totality and Infinity, especially, are bound to one another, companions, like two tablets, or one.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Both are works of ethical metaphysics, distinguished by different but complementary emphases.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The four parts of Totality and Infinity deal successively with justice, sensibility, alterity, and eros.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Followxii ing from and augmenting these, the themes of Otherwise than Being are moral sensibility and language.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The latter are announced in Totality and Infinity, pronounced in Otherwise than Being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Totality and Infinity is focused on ethical alterity, Otherwise than Being on ethical subjectivity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Only an excessive metaphysical desire, a desire for goodness — obligations, responsibilities, the call to justice — can do justice to the radical otherness of the other person.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The title and the content of Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence alert us to the priority Levinas gives to his ongoing contestation of Heideggerian thinking.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Otherwise than Heideggerian being; beyond Heideggerian essence.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Levinas is perhaps the one philosopher who has seen farthest, all the way through and beyond Heideggerian Denken.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The dispute is over the heritage of Husserlian phenomenology.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Whereas Heidegger, in Being and Time, was led to surpass phenomenology in ontology by renewing ""the question of being,"" Levinas, in Totality and Infinity, also surpasses phenomenology, but through the sober exigencies of an ethical metaphysics.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Edmund Husserl — teacher of both Heidegger and Levinas — had pushed science to new and genuine limits.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"He had convincingly shown that modern mathematical science would have to expand to return to its original telos: to be a fully justified, verifiable, self-correcting account of the whole.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Science could no longer reduce and presuppose but would have to expose all evidences, including the evidences of consciousness taken on their own terms.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Levinas is quite influenced by this work, transforming and integrating its analyses into his own ethical vision.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Both philosophers inaugurated their radically differing perspectives through careful analyses of time and sensibility: mortal and anxious being in Heidegger, moral and subject responsibility in Levinas.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The phenomenological analyses of part two of Totality and Infinity revealed a more originary layer of sense in sensibility, beginning in the ""carefree"" contentment of sensing, its self-satisfaction and enjoyment of elemental sensations.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The independence of subjectivity would thus lie more deeply embedded in sensibility than the synthesizing temporal ecstasies of praxis, worldliness, or anxiety.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Rather, the circuits of subjectivity would begin in the very sensing of sensations.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But this also meant that the transcendence of the other would be felt more deeply, in the deepest recesses the flesh, as a suffering for the other, a suffering for the suffering of the other.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
These intertwined structures of sensibility and ethics undercut the meaning bestowing acts foundational to Husserlian intentionally as well as the freedom Heidegger discovered in the essence of truth.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Ethical exorbitance —the height of the other, the subjection of the self, diachrony deeper than synthesis, otherwise than being, beyond essence — accounts for the peculiar structure of Levinas's writings.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In Totality and Infinity ethics appears both before (part one) and after (part three) a phenomenological account of sensibility as ""separated"" being (part two).",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Morality and justice appear before because ethical priorities take priority over the a priori syntheses — cognitive or ontological — immanent to sensibility, praxis, knowledge, and history.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Chapter one, ""The Argument,"" like part one of Totality and Infinity, is a beginning prior to origins.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The demands of goodness do not wait for the completion of knowledge, though the demand for justice will motivate precisely that quantitative task.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Chapters two through five, ""The Exposition,"" renew Levinas's earlier investigations into sensibility, but now building on the whole of Totality and Infinity, elucidating in terms of sensibility itself the obsessive trauma of moral exigencies.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The final pages, ""In Other Words,"" like the ""Conclusions"" of Totality and Infinity, are neither final nor conclusions; they are reformulations, renewals, a re-saying of the saying of the said — infinite, as ethics.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Before language is a poetic harken-ing, it is a radical ethical sincerity: saying as ""my exposure without reserve to the other"" (168), inspiration, witness, prophecy, risk, glory —""proximity and not truth about proximity"" (120).",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"An edifying case: Heidegger's celebrated disciple in France, Jacques Derrida, staked out his own career by borrowing Levinas's notion of the trace of diachrony, an ethical structure.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"He nonetheless purported to bend it for Heideggerian purposes, forcing its radical alterity and an-archy to serve the end of metaphysics, deconstructed through the questioning of language, the language of questioning, differance.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Is it any wonder, then, or rather an irony, that Derrida has become — despite himself? — a ""Levinasian,"" not only paying homage to Levinas, but teaching the very ethical teachings of his teacher?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Levinas has always ""argued"" that relationship with God can only ""come to the idea"" — enter a universal discourse — through ethics.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Levinas is sensitive to the moral and juridical imperfections of our world, such that even an infinite moral response to the one who faces produces injustice for those others not present.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"To give all to one, is to leave others destitute.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
In Otherwise than Being Levinas discovers those absent faces troubling the moral self in the very face of the other.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Morality, without justice, produces injustice, hence immorality.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Justice rectifies in the name of goodness the exclusivity of a self infinitely beholden to the other, rectifies the very desire for goodness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Justice detached from morality, indifferent to its own moral motivation, produces tyranny instead.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Yet such a rectification cannot be accounted for in the first person singular.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The I is infinitely subject to the other.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"We have not ventured to write essance as would be required by the history of the language, where the suffix -ance, deriving from -antia or -entia, gave birth to abstract nouns of action.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
We shall carefully avoid using the term essence or its derivates in their traditional usage.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"For essence, essential, essentially, we will say eidos, eidetic, eidetically, or nature, quiddity, fundamental, etc.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Several extracts from the present work have been published in journals.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Built around Chapter IV, which is its centerpiece, its first version preceded the published texts.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"They were detached from the whole, and were finished in such a way to make them relatively autonomous.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The notion cannot claim to be original, but the access to it is as steep as in ancient times.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The difficulties of the climb, as well as its failures and renewed attempts, are marked in the writing, which no doubt also shows the breathlessness of the author.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But to hear a God not contaminated by Being is a human possibility no less important and no less precarious than to bring Being out of the oblivion in which it is said to have fallen in metaphysics and in onto-theology.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"THE ARGUMENT CHAPTER IESSENCE AND DISINTEREST There is something to be said, Novalis wrote, in favor of passivity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is significant that one of Novalis' contemporaries, Maine de Brain, who wished to be the philosopher of activity, will remain essentially the philosopher of two passivities, the lower and the higher.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"BEING'S ""OTHER"" If transcendence has meaning, it can only signify the fact that the event of being, the esse, the essence,1 passes over to what is other than being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Among the five ""genera"" of the Sophist a genus opposed to being is lacking, even though since the Republic there had been question of what is beyond essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And what can the fact of passing over mean here, where the passing over, ending at being's other, can only undo its facticity during such a passage?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Transcendence is passing over to being's other, otherwise than being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Not to be otherwise, but otherwise than being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
And not to not-be; passing over is not here equivalent to dying.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being and not-being illuminate one another, and unfold a speculative dialectic which is a determination of being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Or else the negativity which attempts to repel being is immediately submerged by being.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The void that hollows out is immediately filled with the mute and anonymous rustling of the there is,2 as the place left vacant by one who died is filled with the murmur of the attendants.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Being's essence dominates not-being itself.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"My death is insignificant - unless I drag into my death the totality of being, as Macbeth wished, at the hour of his last combat.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The statement of being's other, of the otherwise than being, claims to state a difference over and beyond that which separates being from nothingness - the very difference of the beyond, the difference of transcendence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"4 But one immediately wonders if in the formula ""otherwise than being"" the adverb ""otherwise"" does not inevitably refer to the verb to be, which simply has been avoided by an artificially elliptical turn of phrase.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Then what is signified by the verb to be would be ineluctable in everything said, thought and felt.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Our languages woven about the verb to be would not only reflect this undethronable royalty, stronger than that of the gods; they would be the very purple of this royalty.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But then no transcendence other than the factitious transcendence of worlds behind the scenes, of the Heavenly City gravitating in the skies over the terrestrial city, would have meaning.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The Being of beings and of worlds, however different among themselves they may be, weaves among incomparables a common fate; it puts them in conjunction, even if the unity of Being that assembles them is but an analogical unity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Every attempt to disjoin the conjunction and the conjuncture but emphasizes them.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The there is fills the void left by the negation of Being. 2.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"BEING AND INTEREST The essence thus works as an invincible persistance in essence, filling up every interval of nothingness which would interrupt its exercise.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This being interested does not appear only to the mind surprised by the relativity of its negation, and to the man resigned to the meaninglessness of his death; it is not reducible to just this refutation of negativity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
It is confirmed positively to be the conatus of beings.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
And what else can positivity mean but this conatus?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being's interest takes dramatic form in egoisms struggling with one another, each against all, in the multiplicity of allergic egoisms which are at war with one another and are thus together.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
War is the deed or the drama of the essence's interest.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"They all clash, despite the difference of the regions to which the terms in conflict may belong.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Essence thus is the extreme synchronism of war.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Determination is formed, and is already undone, by the clash.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
It takes form and breaks up in a swarming.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Here is extreme contemporaneousness, or immanence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Does not essence revert into its other by peace, in which reason, which suspends the immediate clash of beings, reigns?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Beings become patient, and renounce the allergic intolerance of their persistence in being; do they not then dramatize the otherwise than being?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But this rational peace, a patience and length of time, is calculation, mediation and politics.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The struggle of each against all becomes exchange and commerce.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The clash of each against all in which each comes to be with all, becomes reciprocal limitation and determination, like that of matter.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But the persisting in 5 being, interest, is maintained by the future compensation which will have to equilibriate the concessions patiently and politically consented to in the immediate.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The mass remains permanent and interest remains.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Transcendence is factitious and peace unstable.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And ask if this breathiessness or holding back is not the extreme possibility of the Spirit, bearing a sense of what is beyond the essence? 3.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"THE SAID AND THE SAYING Is not the inescapable fate in which being immediately includes the statement of being's other not due to the hold the said has over the saying, to the oracle in which the said is immobilized?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is not that the essence qua persistance in essence, qua conatus and interest, would be reducible to a word-play.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
It sets forth an order more grave than being and antecedent to being.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
By comparison being appears like a game.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Right off a stakes, money or honor, is attached to it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Does not disinterestedness, without compensation, without eternal life, without the pleasingness of happiness, complete gratuity, indicate an extreme gravity and not the fallacious frivolity of play?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But this pre-original saying does move into a language, in which saying and said are correlative of one another, and the saying is subordinated to its theme.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It can be shown that even the distinction between Being and entities is borne by the amphibology of the said, though this distinction and this amphibology are not thereby reducible to verbal artifices.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The correlation of the saying and the said, that is, the subordination of the saying to the said, to the linguistic system and to ontology, is the price that manifestation demands.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In language qua said everything is conveyed before us, be it at the price of a betrayal.' Language is ancillary and thus indispensable.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Language permits us to utter, be it by betrayal, this outside of being, this ex-ception to being, as though being's other were an event of being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being, its cognition and the said in which it shows itself signify in a saying which, relative to being, forms an exception; but it is in the said that both this exception and the birth of cognition [la naissance de la connaissance] show themselves.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But the fact that the ex-ception shows itself and becomes truth in the said can not serve as a pretext to take as an absolute the apophantic variant of the saying, which is ancillary or angelic.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"An ancillary or angelic variant, however sublime it be, the apophantic form of the saying is only mediating.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"For thematization, in which being's essence is conveyed before us, and theory and thought, its contemporaries, do not attest to some fall of the saying.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"They are motivated by the pre-original vocation of the saying, by responsibility itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
We will see more of this further.4 But apophansis does not exhaust what there is in saying.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The apophansis presupposes the language that answers with responsibility, and the gravity of this response is beyond the measure of being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The impossibility of declining responsibility is reflected only in the scruple or remorse which pre7 cedes or follows this refusal.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The reality of the real ignores scruples.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But, though naturally superficial, essence does not exclude the retreats of responsibility in the way that being excludes nothingness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And the gravity of the responsible saying retains a reference to being, whose nature will have to be made clear.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Moral impossibility is not of lesser gravity; it does not situate responsibility in some low tension zone, at the confines of being and non-being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This gravity of the otherwise than being shows now, in a still confused way, its affinity with ethics.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"We have been seeking the otherwise than being from the beginning, and as soon as it is conveyed before us it is betrayed in the said that dominates the saying which states it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Everything shows itself at the price of this betrayal, even the unsayable.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In this betrayal the indiscretion with regard to the unsayable, which is probably the very task of philosophy, becomes possible.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"When stated in propositions, the unsayable (or the an-archical) espouses the forms of formal logic;5 the beyond being is posited in doxic theses, and glimmers in the amphibology of being and beings -in which beings dissimulate being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The otherwise than being is stated in a saying that must also be unsaid in order to thus extract the otherwise than being from the said in which it already comes to signify but a being otherwise.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Does the beyond being which philosophy states, and states by reason of the very transcendence of the beyond, fall unavoidably into the forms of the ancillary statement?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Can this saying and this being unsaid be assembled, can they be at the same time?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
In fact to require this simultaneity is already to reduce being's other to being and not being.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
We must stay with the extreme situation of a diachronic thought.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Skepticism, at the dawn of philosophy, set forth and betrayed the diachrony of this very conveying and betraying.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Freedom, an interruption of the determinism of war and matter, does not escape the fate in essence and takes place in time and in the history which assembles events into an epos and synchronizes them, revealing their immanence and their order.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The task is to conceive'' of the possibility of a break out of essence.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But the extraction from essence contests the unconditional privilege of the question ""where?""; it signifies a null-site [non-lieu].",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The ego is an incomparable unicity; it is outside of the community of genus and form, and does not find any rest in itself either, unquiet, not coinciding with itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The history of philosophy, during some flashes, has known this subjectivity that, as in an extreme youth, breaks with essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The Nietzschean man above all was such a moment.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"For Husserl's transcendental reduction will a putting between parentheses suffice-a type of writing, of commiting oneself with the world, which sticks like ink to the hands that push it off?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"One should have to go all the way to the nihilism of Nietzsche's poetic writing, reversing irreversible time in vortices, to the laughter which refuses language.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"9 The philosopher finds language again in the abuses of language of the history of philosophy, in which the unsayable and what is beyond being are conveyed before us.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But negativity, still correlative with being, will not be enough to signify the other than being. 5.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OTHER But how, at the still temporal breaking point where being comes to pass, would being and time fall into ruins so as to disengage subjectivity from its essence?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Do not the falling into ruins and the disengagement last; do they not occur in being?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The otherwise than being cannot be situated in any eternal order extracted from time that would somehow command the temporal series.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Kant has shown the impossibility of that in the antithesis of the fourth Antinomy.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is then the temporalization of time, in the way it signifies being and nothingness, life and death, that must also signify the beyond being and not being; it must signify a difference with respect to the couple being and nothingness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Time is essence and monstration of essence.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In the temporalization of time the light comes about by the instant falling out of phase with itself-which is the temporal flow, the differing of the identical.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The differing of the identical is also its manifestation.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But time is also a recuperation of all divergencies, through retention, memory and history.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Can it, on the contrary, remain foreign to every present, every representation, and thus signify a past more ancient than every representable origin, a pre-original and anarchical passed!",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The signalling of this pre-original past in the present would not again be an ontological relation.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But if time is to show an ambiguity of being and the otherwise than being, its temporalization is to be conceived not as essence, but as saying.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
This equivocation or enigma is an inalienable power in saying and a modality of transcendence.7 Subjectivity is a node and a denouement - of essence and essence's other.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But how is the saying, in its primordial enigma, said?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"How is time tem-poralized such that the dia-chrony of transcendence, of the other than being, is signalled?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
How can transcendence withdraw from esse while being signalled in it?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"A linear regressive movement, a retrospective back along the temporal series toward a very remote past, would never be able to reach the absolutely diachronous pre-original which cannot be recuperated by memory and history.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But it may be that we have to unravel other intrigues of time than that of the simple succession of presents.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Men have been able to be thankful for the very fact of finding themselves able to thank; the present gratitude is grafted onto itself as onto an already antecedent gratitude.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In a prayer in which the worshipper asks that his prayer be heard, the prayer as it were precedes or follows itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The freedom of another could never begin in my freedom, that is, abide in the same present, be contemporary, be representable to me.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The responsibility for the other can not have begun in my commitment, in my decision.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The responsibility for the other is the locus in which is situated the null-site of subjectivity, where the privilege of the question ""Where?"" no longer holds.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
ESSENCE AND SIGNIFICATION But is not the relationship with this pre-original a recuperation?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Not out of weakness; to what could not be contained there corresponds no capacity.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The non-present is in-comprehendable by reason of its immensity or its ""superlative"" humility or. for example, its goodness, which is the superlative itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The non-present here is invisible, separated (or sacred) and thus a non-origin, an-archical.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The Good cannot become present or enter into a representation.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The present is a beginning in my freedom, whereas the Good is not presented to freedom; it has chosen me before I have chosen it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
We can see the formal structure of nonfiee-dom in a subjectivity which does not have time to choose the Good and thus is penetrated with its rays unbeknownst to itself.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But subjectivity sees this nonfreedom redeemed, exceptionally, by the goodness of the Good.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And if no one is good voluntarily, no one is enslaved to the Good.8 Immemorial, unrepresentable, invisible, the past that bypasses the present, the pluperfect past, falls into a past that is a gratuitous lapse.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It can not be recuperated by reminiscence not because of its remoteness, but because of its incommensurability with the present.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The present is essence that begins and ends, beginning and end assembled in a thematizable conjunction; it is the finite in correlation with a freedom.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Diachrony.is the refusal of conjunction, the non-totaiizable, and in this sense, infinite.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
It thus diverges from nothingness as well as from being.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It provokes this responsibility against my will, that is, by substituting me for the other as a hostage.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"All my inwardness is invested in the form of a despite-me, for-another.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Despite-me, for-another, is signification par excellence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And it is the sense of the ""oneself,"" that accusative that derives from no nominative;9 it is the very fact of finding oneself while losing oneself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
What is exceptional in this way of being signalled is that I am ordered toward the face of the other.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
In this order which is an ordination the non12 presence of the infinite is not only a figure of negative theology.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"All the negative attributes which state what is beyond the essence become positive in responsibility, a response answering to a non-thematizable provocation and thus a non-vocation, a trauma.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"That trace lights up as the face of a neighbor, ambiguously him before whom (or to whom, without any paternalism) and him for whom I answer.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"What is positive in responsibility, outside of essence, conveys the infinite.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It inverses relationships and principles, reverses the order of interest: in the measure that responsibilities are taken on they multiply.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
This is not a Sollen commanding the infinite pursuit of an ideal.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The infinity of the infinite lives in going backwards.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The debt increases in the measures that it is paid.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
This divergency perhaps deserves the name glory.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The positivity of the infinite is the conversion of the response to the infinite into responsibility, into approach of the other.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The Infinite is non-thematizable, gloriously exceeds every capacity, and manifests, as it were in reverse, its exorbitance in the approach of a neighbor, obedient to its measure.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Subjectivity, prior to or beyond the free and the non-free, obliged with regard to the neighbor, is the breaking point where essence is exceeded by the infinite.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is the breaking-point, but also the binding place; the glow of a trace is enigmatic, equivocal.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is so in still another sense, which distinguishes it from the appearing of phenomena.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It cannot serve as the point of departure for a demonstration, which inexorably would bring it into immanence and essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
A trace is sketched out and effaced in a face in the equivocation of a saying.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
In this way it modulates the modality of the transcendent.I0 The infinite then cannot be tracked down like game by a hunter.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The trace left by the infinite is not the residue of a presence; its very glow is ambiguous.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Otherwise, its positivity would not preserve the infinity of the infinite any more than negativity would.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The infinite wipes out its traces not in order to trick him who obeys, but because it transcends the present in which it commands me, and because I cannot deduce it from this command.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The infinite who orders me is neither a cause acting straight on, nor a theme, already dominated, if only retrospectively, by freedom.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This detour at a face and this detour from this detour in the enigma of a trace we have called illeity."" Illeity lies outside the ""thou"" and the thematization of objects.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"A neologism formed with // (he) or ille, it indicates a way of concerning me without entering into conjunction with me.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"To be sure, we have to indicate the 13 element in which this concerning occurs.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The illeity in the beyond-being is the fact that its coming toward me is a departure which lets me accomplish a movement toward a neighbor.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The positive element of this departure, that which makes this departure, this diachrony, be more than a term of negative theology, is my responsibility for the others.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Or, one may say, it is the fact that the others show themselves in their face.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"There is a paradox in responsibility, in that I am obliged without this obligation having begun in me, as though an order slipped into my consciousness like a thief, smuggled itself in, like an effect of one of Plato's wandering causes.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But this is impossible in a consciousness, and clearly indicates that we are no longer in the element of consciousness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In consciousness this ""who knows where"" is translated into an anachronical overwhelming, the antecedence of responsibility and obedience with respect to the order received or the contract.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Or as though it were formulated before every possible present, in a past that shows itself in the present of obedience without being recalled, without coming from memory, being formulated by him who obeys in his very obedience.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But this is still perhaps a quite narrative, epic, way of speaking.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Am I the interlocutor of an infinity lacking in straightforwardness, giving its commands indirectly in the very face to which it ordains me?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Illeity, which does not simply designate an oblique presentation to a squinting look, may indeed first signify such a disposition of personages.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The infinite does not signal itself to a subjectivity, a unity already formed, by its order to turn toward the neighbor.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
In its being subjectivity undoes essence by substituting itself for another.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Qua one-for-another, it is absorbed in signification, in saying or the verb form of the infinite.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is not a stage of cognition calling for the intuition that would fulfill it, nor the absurdity of nonidentity or of impossible identity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Not a reference from one term to another, as it appears thematized in the said, but substitution as the very subjectivity of a subject, interruption of the irreversible identity of the essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It occurs in the taking charge of, which is incumbent on me without any escape possible.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Here the unicity of the ego first acquires a meaning - where it is no longer a question of the ego, but of me.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The subject which is not an ego, but which I am, cannot be generalized, is not a subject in",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"14 general; we have moved from the ego to me who am me and no one else.12 Here the identity of the subject comes from the impossibility of escaping responsibility, from the taking charge of the other.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Signification, saying - my expressivity, my own signifyingness qua sign, my own verbal-ity qua verb - cannot be understood as a modality of being; the disinterestedness suspends essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas

"As signification, proximity, saying, separation, 1 do not fuse with anything.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Have we to give a name to this relationship of signification grasped as subjectivity?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Must we pronounce the word expiation, and conceive the subjectivity of the subject, the otherwise than being, as an expiation?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
That would perhaps be bold and premature.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"At least we can ask if subjectivity qua signification, qua one-for-another, is not traceable back to the vulnerability of the ego, to the incommunicable, non-conceptualizable, sensibility. 7.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"SENSIBILITY Man is not to be conceived in function of being and not-being, taken as ultimate references.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Signification, prior to being, breaks up the assembling, the recollection or the present of essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"On the hither side of or beyond essence, signification is the breathlessness of the spirit expiring without inspiring, disinterestedness and gratuity or gratitude; the breakup of essence is ethics.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This breakup of identity, this changing of being into signification, that is, into substitution, is the subject's subjectivity, or its subjection to everything, its susceptibility, its vulnerability, that is, its sensibility.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Subjectivity, locus and null-site of this breakup, comes to pass as a passivity more passive than all passivity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas

"This exposure is the frankness, sincerity, veracity of saying.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Substitution, at the limit of being, ends up in saying, in the giving of signs, giving a sign of this giving of signs, expressing oneself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This expression is antecedent to all thematization in the said, but it is not a babbling or still primitive or childish form of saying.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This stripping beyond nudity, beyond forms, is not the work of negation and no longer belongs to the order of being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
For the Good can not enter into a present nor be put into a representation.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But being Good it redeems the violence of its alterity, even if the subject has to suffer through the augmentation of this ever more demanding violence. 8.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Everywhere proximity is conceived ontologically, that is, as a limit or complement to the accomplishment of the adventure of essence, which consists in persisting in essence and unfolding immanence, in remaining in an ego, in identity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The present study sets out to not conceive proximity in function of being.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The otherwise than being which, to be sure, is understood in a being, differs absolutely from essence, has no genus in common with essence, and is said only in the breathlessness that pronounces the extra-ordinary word beyond.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Alterity figures in it outside any qualification of the other for the ontological order and outside any attribute.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It figures as what is near in a proximity that counts as sociality, which ""excites"" by its pure and simple proximity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The way of thinking proposed here does not fail to recognize being or treat it, ridiculously and pretentiously, with disdain, as the fall from a higher order or disorder.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"On the contrary, it is on the basis of proximity that being takes on its just meaning.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In the indirect ways of iileity, in the anarchical provocation which ordains me to the other, is imposed the way which leads to thematization, and to an act of consciousness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
A third party is also approached; and the relationship between the neighbor and the third party cannot be indifferent to me when I approach.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
There must be a justice among incomparable ones.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"There must then be a comparison between incomparables and a synopsis, a togetherness and contemporaneousness; there must be thematization, thought, history and inscription.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But being must be understood on the basis of being's other.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"To be on the ground of the signification of an approach is to be with another for or against a third party, with the other and the third party against oneself, in justice.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This way of thinking is against a philosophy which does not see beyond being, and reduces, by an abuse of language, saying to the said and all sense to interest.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Reason, to which the virtue of arresting violence is ascribed, issuing in the order of peace, presupposes disinterestedness, passivity or patience.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In this disinterestedness, when, as a responsibility for the other, it is also a responsibility for the third party, the justice that compares, assembles and conceives, the synchrony of being and peace, take form. 17 9.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"SUBJECTIVITY IS NOT AMODALITY OF ESSENCE The problem of transcendence and of God and the problem of subjectivity irreducible to essence, irreducible to essential immanence, go together.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But is subjectivity thus conceived in what is irreducibly its own?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Hegel and Heidegger try to empty the distinction between the subject and being of its meaning.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is in the midst of the Absolute that the beyond takes on meaning; essence, understood as the immanence of a knowing, is taken to account for subjectivity, which is reduced to a moment of the concept, of thought or of absolute essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Every overcoming as well as every revaluing of Being in the subject would still be a case of Being's essence.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Nor even in terms of entities, which one would suspect modulate being, and thus heal the break marked by the hypostasis.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The subject already resists this ontologization when it is conceived as a saying.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Behind every statement of being as being, the saying overflows the very being it thematizes in stating it to the other.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Irreducible to being's essence is the substitution in responsibility, signification or the one-for-another, or the defecting of the ego beyond every defeat, going countercurrent to a conatus, or goodness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In it the other is imposed quite differently from the reality of the real: he imposes himself because he is other, because this alterity is incumbent on me with a whole charge of indigence and weakness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Can substitution and goodness in turn be interpreted as a ""movement"" or a modality of being's essence?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Would it yet move in the light of being?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But is the sight of a face in the light of being?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Is not sight here immediately a taking charge?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The intention toward another, when it has reached its peak, turns out to belie inten-tionality.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Toward another culminates in a for another, a suffering for his suffering, without light, that is, without measure, quite different from the purely negative blinding of Fortune which only seems to close her eyes so as to give her richess arbitrarily.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas

"It no longer keeps accounts; it is not like negativity, which conserves what it negates, in its history.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It destroys without leaving souvenirs, without transporting into museums the altars raised to the idols of the past for blood sacrifices, it burns the sacred groves in which the echoes of the past reverberate.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The exceptional, extra-ordinary, transcendent character of goodness is due to just this break with being and history.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"To reduce the good to being, to its calculations and its history, is to nullify goodness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The ever possible sliding between subjectivity and being, of which subjectivity would be but a mode, the equivalence of the two languages, stops here.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Goodness gives to subjectivity its irreducible signification.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The human subject — me — called on the brink of tears and laughter to responsibility, is not an avatar of nature or a moment of the concept, or an articulation of ""being's presence to us,"" or parousia.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas

"19 souls"" and preferring ""the effort of concepts"" to the facilities of psychological naturalism, humanist rhetoric and existentialist pathetics, to forget what is better than being, that is, the Good.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The beyond being, being's other or the otherwise than being, here situated in diachrony, here expressed as infinity, has been recognized as the Good by Plato.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
It matters little that Plato made of it an idea and a light source.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This diachrony is itself an enigma: the beyond being does and does not revert to ontology; the statement, the beyond, the infinite, becomes and does not become a meaning of being. 10.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
THE ITINERARY The different concepts that come up in the attempt to state transcendence echo one another.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Perhaps the clarity of the exposition does not suffer here only from the clumsiness of the expounder.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The exposition is worked out between the present argument, which introduces it, and the final chapter, which, as conclusion, elucidates it in a different way.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It will do so by linking to the alternating fate of skepticism in philosophical thought - refuted and coming back 20 again - the alternatings or diachrony, resisting assemblage, of the otherwise than being or transcendence, and its exposition.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Is the itinerary whose stages we have just indicated sufficiently reliable?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Will the reproach not be made that this movement is not sufficiently warned of the dangers on the way and has not provided itself with means to ward them off?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"No doubt it is not completely disengaged from pre-philosophical experiences, and many of its byways will appear well-worn, many of its thrusts imprudent.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But a fine risk is always something to be taken in philosophy.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Should we not think with as much precaution of the possibility of a conclusion or a closure of the philosophical discourse?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Is not its interruption its only possible end?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"More modestly, Husserl will have taught us that every movement of thought involves a part of naivety, which, in the Hegelian enterprise, lies at least in its pretention to include the Real.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Philosophy thus arouses a drama between philosophers and an inter-subjective movement which does not resemble the dialogue of teamworkers in science, nor even the Platonic dialogue which is the reminiscence of a drama rather than the drama itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"QUESTIONING AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE OTHER A philosopher seeks, and expresses, truth.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Truth, before characterizing a statement or a judgment, consists in the exhibition of being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But what shows itself, in truth, under the name of being?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Does the word being designate an entity, ideal or real, that is, or this entity's process of being, its essence!1 And does this word designate!",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"For if it only designates, then, even taken as a verb, it is a noun.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And the process captured by the designation, even if it is a movement, shows itself, but is immobilized and fixed in the said.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Does the mystery of being and entities, their difference, disturb us already?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The distinction and the amphibology of being and entities will turn out from the start to be important and to be determinant for truth, but this distinction is also an amphibology and does not signify the ultimate.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"If this difference shows itself in the said, in words (which are not epiphenomenal), if it belongs to monstration as such, it belongs on the same plane as being, whose hide-and-seek game is indeed essential.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But if monstration is a modality of signification, we would have to go back from the said to the saying.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The said and the non-said do not absorb all the saying, which remains on this side of, or goes beyond, the said.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But let us for the moment stay with what is implied in the general meaning of truth.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The question ""what shows itself?"" is put by him who looks, even before he thematically distinguishes the difference between being and entities.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The question enunciates a ""what?' ""what is it?"" ""what is it that it is?"" Concerning what is it wants to know what it is.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The ""what?"" is already wholly enveloped with being, has eyes only for being, and already sinks into being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Concerning the being of what is, it wants to know what it is.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The question - even ""what is being?"" - then questions with respect to being, with respect to what is precisely in question.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The answer required is from the start in terms of being, whether one understands by it entity or being of entities, entity or being's essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The question ""what?"" is thus correlative",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"24 of what it wishes to discover, and already has recourse to it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Its quest occurs entirely within being, in the midst of what it is seeking.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is ontology, and at the same time has a part in the effectuation of the very being it seeks to understand.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Being would be not only what is most problematical; it would be what is most intelligible.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And yet, this intelligibility is questionable.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
That intelligibility would become questionable is something surprising.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Here is a problem preliminary to the questions ""who?"" and ""what?""2 Why is there a question in exhibition?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"One could immediately answer that there is a question because there is an inquiry, and because the appearing of being is also the possibility of its appearance, and appearance dissimulates being in its very disclosure.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The search for truth has to draw being out of appearance.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Consequently truth is a progression, and is exposed in several moments, remaining problematical in each.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Yet the question about the question is more radical still.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Why does research take form as a question?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"How is it that the ""what?"", already steeped in being so as to open it up the more, becomes a demand and a prayer, a special language inserting into the ""communication"" of the given an appeal for help, for aid addressed to another?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The problem is not aroused, like a bad quarrel, by a capricious or curios or industrious subject approaching being, which would be non-problematical in itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But it is not necessary to take literally the metaphor of the interpellation of the subject by being which manifests itself.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The manifestation of being, the appearing, is indeed the primary event, but the very primacy of the primary is in the presence of the present.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In the diachrony which turned up under our pen above, with regard to the progressiveness of manifestation, one can suspect there is the interval that separates the same from the other, an interval that is reflected in manifestation.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"For manifestation, which one might have thought to be by right a fulgurating instant of openness and intuition, is discontinuous, and lasts from a question to the response.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But 25 this leads us to surprise the Who that is looking, the identical subject, allegedly placed in the openness of Being, as the crux of a diachronic plot (which remains to be determined) between the same and the other.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The silent coming and going from question to response, with which Plato characterized thought, already refers to a plot in which is tied up the node of subjectivity, by the other commanding the same.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The reference is there even when, turned toward being in its manifestation, thought knows itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Asking oneself and questioning oneself does not undo the torsion of the same and the other in subjectivity; it refers to it.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
There is an intrigue of the other in the same which does not amount to an openness of the other to the same.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Here is where the quis-nity of the ""what"" excepts itself from the onto-logical quiddity of the ""what"" sought which orients the research.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The same has to do with the other before the other appears in any way to a consciousness.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Subjectivity is structured as the other in the same, but in a way different from that of consciousness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Consciousness is always correlative with a theme, a present represented, a theme put before me, a being which is a phenomenon.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Subjectivity is the other in the same, in a way that also differs from that of the presence of interlocutors to one another in a dialogue, in which they are at peace and in agreement with one another.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The other in the same determinative of subjectivity is the restlessness of the same disturbed by the other.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This is not the correlation characteristic of intentionality, nor even that of dialogue, which attests to essence by its essential reciprocity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The folding back of being upon itself, and the self formed by this fold, where the effect of being remains correlative with being, also does not go to the crux of subjectivity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This allegiance will be described as a responsibility of the same for the other, as a response to his 26 proximity before any question.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In this responsibility the latent birth of consciousness itself as a perception or listening in to being, can be surprised, and dialogue based on questioning.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being then would not be the construction of a cognitive subject, contrary to what idealism claims.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The subject opening to the thought and truth of being', as it incontestably does, opens upon a way quite different from that which lets the subject be seen as an ontology or an understanding of being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
This not coming from cognition has a quite different meaning than ontology supposes.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being and cognition together signify in the proximity of the other and in a certain modality of my responsibility for the other, this response preceding any question, this saying before the said.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being signifies on the basis of the one-for-the-other, of substitution of the same for the other.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Both being and the vision of being refer to a subject that has risen earlier than being and cognition, earlier than and on this side of them, in an immemorial time which a reminiscene could not recuperate as an a priori.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The ""birth"" of being in the questioning where the cognitive subject stands would thus refer to a before the questioning, to the anarchy of responsibility, as it were on this side of all birth.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"We will try, with the notion of the saying without the said, to expose such a modality of the subjective, an otherwise than being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"We will have to answer for the liberties that we are thus taking with the eventual as though there were no risks, forgetting the first pages and the warnings of the Introduction to the Phenomenology of Mind.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"At least the first indications of these eventualities permit us to announce the orientation of this chapter, which does not begin by running up against the finitude of the subject devoted to the relativity of a forever unfinished science.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Then one will have to stay with the design of this ontology, even if in certain of its implications inflexions of forgotten voices resound.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"To ontology, the exposition of being in its amphibology of being and entitles, belong time and 27 language, inasmuch as language, assembling the dispersion of duration into nouns and propositions, lets being and entities be heard.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"We have shown that the question ""What shows itself in truth?"" questions the being that exhibits itself in terms of this being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The question ""who is looking?"" is also ontological.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Such a ""who?"" amounts to a ""what?"", to ""what about him?"" It goes back to that, or gets lost in it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The difference between ""who?"" and ""what?"" which is reflected in vocabulary and grammar would be only eidetic or essential, motivated by the nature or mode of being of the entity that is problematical.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And the logical supremacy of the ""what?"" in the said abolishes this difference.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In the ""who is this whoT it asks ""what about this whoT to which the look turned on being is given.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This privilege means that, in all cases, in asking ourselves, with regard to truth: ""who is looking at being manifesting itself in truth?"", the welcoming of the manifestation of being could not take place outside of the being that manifests itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The response to the question ""who is looking?"" then could in its turn signify only the exposition of essence: the subject of the look will be a thinking being, in a strict correlation with its object, belonging to the subject-object unity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Moreover, how, if one starts with the notion of the truth, could one place the welcoming of the manifestation of being outside of the being that manifests itself?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Can he that looks place himself outside of the Absolute, and the look withdraw from the event of being, by hollowing out the fold of inwardness, in which knowledge is deposited, accumu28 lates and is formulated?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But then things would happen outside of being, and there would still be being there, which seems to be contradictory in its terms.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"We are not yet in a position to see clearly in this semblance, still less to reduce it, even if we suspect that there is in the position in which the folding back of being upon itself, or subjectivity, is produced something else than this reflection.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is then necessary that the one to whom being shows itself still belongs to being, and that looking amounts to being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Is the ""who"" - the spectator, the subjectivity, the soul - exhausted in this process of interiori-zation?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Or is interiorization all there is in the negativity of ""not showing oneself?"" That is in fact our problem: what does ""who?"" mean?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But if the inwardness were an absolute exception, the being discovered in truth would be truncated of its inwardness; it would be in truth partly dissimulated, apparent and non-true.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Truth can consist only in the exposition of being to itself, in self-consciousness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The upsurge of a subjectivity, a soul, a ""who,"" remains correlative with being, that is, simultaneous and one with it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The mutation of the exhibition into knowledge has to be interpretable as a certain inflexion of this exhibition.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The soul would live only for the disclosure of being which arouses it or provokes it; it would be a moment of the life of the Spirit, that is, of Being-totality, leaving nothing outside of itself, the same finding again the same.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But the manifestation of being to itself would imply a separation in being.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The getting out of phase of the instant, the ""all"" pulling off from the ""all"" - the temporality of time - makes possible, however, a recuperation in which nothing is lost.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"There is a disclosing of being; disengaged from its identity, from itself (what we are here calling a getting out of phase) and rediscoveries of truth; between what shows itself and the aim it fulfills, there is monstration.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
There is the same as this aim and the same as discov-,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"29 ered, only discovered and amounting to the same— truth.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Time is needed, the remission of the immobile eternity, of the immanence of the whole in the whole, in order that there be established the new tension, unique in its kind, through which intentionality or thought is awakened in being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Truth is rediscovery, recall, reminiscence, reuniting under the unity of apperception.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"There is remission of time and tension of the recapture, relaxation and tension without a break, without a gap.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Time is reminiscence and reminiscence is time, the unity of consciousness and essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But in the totality of being temporally getting out of phase, which alone could be sufficient for truth, would the totality, diverging from itself, go ""beyond totality""?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Yet totality should not leave anything outside.3 Then the transcendence of the totality thematized in truth is produced as a division of the totality into parts.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"How can these parts still be equivalent to the whole, as is implied when exposition is truth?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The whole reflected in a part is an image.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Truth then would be produced in the images of being.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas

"Philosophy is disclosure of being, and being's essence is truth and philosophy.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being's essence is the temporalization of time, the diastasis of the identical and its recapture or reminiscence, the unity of apperception.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Being's essence designates nothing that could be a nameable content, a thing, event or action; it names this mobility of the immobile, this multiplication of the identical, this diastasis of the punctual, this lapse.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The work of being, essence, time, the lapse of time, is exposition, truth, philosophy.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In it forms are illuminated where knowledge is awakened; in it being leaves the night, or, at least, quits sleep, that night of night, for an unextinguish-able insomnia of consciousness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Temporality, in the divergence of the identical from itself, is essence and original light, that which Plato distinguished from the visibility of the visible and the clairvoyance of the eye.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The time of the essence unites the three moments of knowing.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Is the light of essence which makes things seen itself seen?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But then light presents itself in light, which latter is not thematic, but resounds for the ""eye that listens,"" with a resonance unique in its kind, a resonance of silence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Expressions such as the eye that listens to the resonance of silence are not monstrosities, for they speak of the way one approaches the temporafity of the true, and in temporality being deploys its essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The question remains: are this night or this sleep which being would ""quit"" by means of time so as to manifest itself still essence, simple negations of light and wakefulness?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Or ""are"" they an ""otherwise"" or a ""hither side""?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"By virtue of a temporality beyond reminiscence, in diachrony, beyond essence, are they on this side of, or beyond, otherwise than being, indeed liable to being shown in the 31 said, but then immediately reduced?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Is the subject completely comprehensible out of ontology?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"That is one of the principle problems of the present research-or, more exactly, that is what it puts into question. 3.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Sensuous Lived Experience The disclosure of all things depends on their insertion in this light, or this resonance, of the time of essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Things are discovered in their qualities, but the qualities are in lived experience, which is temporal.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The exposition, the phenomenality of being, can not be separated from time.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"These qualities would be distinguishable from every other given by their immediate presence, their fullness of content, their richness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Though changing, they would vary only outside of the lived experience, on the plane of the sensed, beyond the sensing.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The lived and the sensed, the lived and the sensible qualities, would thus be separated by an ""open chasm of meaning,"" as Husserl put it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The sensible is not revealed in the exposition that would be the fulgurating instant of a noesis, would be pure welcome.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The noesis itself has a temporal stretching in it, and is constituted in time; it refers in its intention to the materiality of a vkrj.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Husserl agrees, and emphasizes this more than anyone today, rehabilitating the teachings of a venerable philosophical tradition which he seems to contest by certain aspects of the theses he puts forth.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The sensorial qualities are 32 not only the sensed: as affective states, they are the sensing.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"One can very well attribute to sensing an intentionality that identifies colors and objective sounds, still it is itself an abridged version of these colors and sounds.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
This specific intentionality is time itself.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"There is consciousness insofar as the sensible impression differs from itself without differing; it differs without differing, is other within identity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The impression is illuminated by ""opening up,"" as though it plugged itself up; it undoes that coincidence of self with self in which the ""same"" is smothered under itself, as under a candle extinguisher.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is not in phase with itself; just past, about to come.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But to differ within identity, to maintain the moment that is being altered, is ""protaining"" and ""retaining""!",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Differing within identity, modifying itself without changing, consciousness glows in an impression inasmuch as it diverges from itself, to still be expecting itself, or already recuperating itself.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Still, already - are time, time in which nothing is lost.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The past itself is modified without changing its identity, diverges from itself without letting go of itself, ""becomes older,"" sinking into a deeper past: it remains identical with itself through retention of retention, and so on.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Then memory recuperates in images what retention was not able to preserve, and historiography reconstructs that whose image is lost.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
To speak of consciousness is to speak of time.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"At a level which for Husserl is originary, temporality involves a consciousness that is not even intentional in the ""specific"" sense of retention.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Husserl will then have liberated the psyche from the primacy of the theoretical neither in the order of know-how with equipment nor in that of axiological emotion, nor in the thought of Being, different from the metaphysics of entities.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Though it be a rehabilitation of the ""sensorial given"" of empiricist sensualism, the primal impression finds again in the context of intentionality (which for Husserl remains all-encompassing) its power to surprise.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Here consciousness is produced outside of all negativity in Being (which still operates in the temporality of retentions and protentions).,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Through the notion of the living present, the notion of origin and of creation, a spontaneity in which activity and passivity are completely one, tend to become intelligible.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Nothing enters incognito into the same, to interrupt the flow of time and interrupt the consciousness that is produced in the form of this flow.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"A putting the self-identity of the living present out of phase, a putting of the phases themselves out of phase, in the intentionality",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"34 of retentions and protentions, the flow looks like a multiplication of modification dispersing from the living present.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Rather than being a metaphor taken from the movement of waters in a river, would not flowing be the very temporality of time and the ""science"" of which ""consciousness"" (conscience) is made?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The temporal modification is not an event, nor an action, nor the effect of a cause.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Language The verb understood as a noun designating an event, when applied to the temporalization of time, would make it resound as an event, whereas every event already presupposes time.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Time's modification without change, the putting of the identical out of phase with itself, teems behind the transformations and the endurance, and, as ageing, even within endurance.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And yet a verb perhaps comes into its very verbalness by ceasing to name actions and events, ceasing to name.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is here that a word ""has its own ways,"" unique of their kind, irreducible to symbolization which names or evokes.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This time can, to be sure, be recuperated in retention, memory, ""tales,"" and books.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The relationship between the verb and being, or being's essence is not that between genus and species.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Essence, temporalization, is the verbalness of a verb.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Language issued from the verbalness of a verb would then not only consist in making being understood, but also in making its essence vibrate.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Language is thus not reducible to a system of signs doubling up beings and relations; that conception would be incumbent on us if words were nouns.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Language seems rather to be an excrescence of the verb.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
And qua verb it already bears sensible life - temporalization and being's essence.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The lived sensation, being and time, is already understood in a verb.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In sensibility the qualities of perceived things turn into time and into consciousness, independently of the soundless space in which they seem to unfold in a mute world.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But has not then sensibility already been said!,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Do not its qualitative variations make the how of the verb stated in it understood?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Do not the sensations in which the sensible qualities are lived resound adverbially, and, more precisely, as adverbs of the verb to be?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But then if they could be surprised on the hither side of the said, would they not reveal another meaning!",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Denomination designates or constitutes identities in the verbal or temporal flow of sensation.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The ""this as that"" is not lived; it is said.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Identification is understood on the basis of a mysterious schematism, of the already said, an antecedent doxa which every relationship between the universal and the individual presupposes.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
For this relationship evidently can not be based on resemblance.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The said is not simply a sign or an expression of a meaning; it proclaims and establishes this as that.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In the doxa, the already said, tale, epos, the given is held in its theme.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But this ambiguity and this gnoseological function of sensibility, this ambiguity of the understanding and intuition that does not exhaust the signifyingness of the sensible and of immediacy, is its play, logical and ontological, as consciousness.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
This play does not begin by caprice; we will have to show the horizon in which it occurs.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But this play does not undo the responsibilities that arouse it.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In analyzing the sensible in the ambiguity of duration and identity, which is already the ambiguity of the verb and the noun that scintillates in the said, we have found it already said.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Or, if one likes, our analysis concerned the time that marks historiography, that is, the recuperable time, the recoverable time, the lost time that can be found again.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"As the time narrated becomes, in the narrative and in writing, a reversible time, every phenomenon is said, characterized by the simultaneity of the successive in a theme.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In the remission or detente of time, the same modified retains itself on the verge of losing itself, is inscribed in memory and is identified, is said.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
These rediscoveries are an identification - of this as this or as that.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Identification is ascription of meaning.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
Entities show themselves in their meanings to be identical entities.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"They are not first given and thematized, and then receive a meaning; they are given by the meaning they have.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But these rediscoveries by identification occur in an already said.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The Said and the Saying The identity of entities refers to a saying teleologically turned to the ke-rygma of the said, absorbing itself in it to the extent of being forgotten in it.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It refers to a saying that would be correlative with the said, or that would idealize the identity of entities.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"This saying would thus constitute that identity, and recuperate the irreversible, coagulate the flow of time into a ""something,"" thematize, ascribe a meaning.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It would take up a position with regard to this ""something,"" fixed in a present, re-present it to itself, and thus extract it from the labile character of time.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The saying extended toward the said24 and absorbed in it, correlative with it, names an entity, in the light or resonance of lived time which allows a phenomenon to appear.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
This light and resonance can in turn be identified in another said.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The designation and resonance are not just added on to a phenomenon from the outside, by the effect of a conventional code which regulates the usage of a system of signs.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is through the already said that words, elements of a historically constituted vocabulary, will come to function as signs and acquire a usage,23 and bring about the proliferation of all the possibilities of vocabulary.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The entity that appears identical in the light of time is its essence in the already said.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The phenomenon itself is a phenomenology.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is not that a discourse, coming from one knows not where, arbitrarily arranges the phases of temporality into a ""this as that."" The very exposition of Being, its manifestation, essence qua essence and entities qua entities, are spoken.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is only in the said, in the epos of saying, that the diachrony of time is synchronized into a time that is recallable, and becomes a theme.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
The epos is not added to the identical entities it exposes; it exposes them as identities illuminated by a memorable temporality.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"And it is for that that man is a being of truth, belonging to no other genus of being.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But the signification of saying goes beyond the said.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The immemorial is not an effect of a weakness of memory, an incapacity to cross large intervals of time, to resuscitate pasts too deep.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"It is the impossibility of the dispersion of time to assemble itself in the present, the insurmountable diachrony of time, a beyond the said.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
It is diachrony that determines the immemorial; a weakness of memory does not constitute diachrony.,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
But then we have this problem: is not diachrony characterizable only negatively?,levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"For such a signification what is signified would not be a ""something"" identified in the theme of the said, a ""this as that"" illuminated in the memorable time of essence.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Need temporalization signify only by letting itself be understood in the said, in which its diachrony is exposed to synchronization?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"If saying is not only the correlative of a said, if its signifyingness is not absorbed in the signification said, can we not find beyond or on the hither side of the saying that tells being the signifyingness of diachrony?",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Behind being and its monstration, there is now already heard the resonance of other significations forgotten in ontology, which now solicit our inquiry.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"But before entering into this inquiry concerning the saying, let us return to the structure of the said, in which identical entities, beings, are shown.28 d.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"The Amphibology of Being and Entities Time and the essence it unfolds by manifesting entities, identified in the themes of statements or narratives, resound as a silence without becoming themes themselves.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"They can, to be sure, be named in a theme, but this naming does not reduce to definitive silence the mute resonance, the murmur of silence, in which essence is identified as an entity.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Once again for the ""listening eye"" a silence resounds about what had been muffled, the silence of the parcelling out of being, by which entities in their identities are illuminated and show themselves.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"In a predicative proposition, an apophansis, an entity can make itself be understood verbally, as a ""way"" of essence, as the fruitio essendi itself, as a how, a modality of this essence or this temporalization.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"Already the tautological predication, A is A, in which an entity is both subject and predicate, does not only signify the inherence of A in itself or the fact that A possesses all the characteristics of A.",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
"A is A is to be understood also as ""the sound resounds"" or ""the red reddens"" - or as ""AAs."" In",levinas,Otherwise Than Being — Emmanuel Levinas
