"For those who are racked by melancholia, writing about it would have meaning only if writing sprang out of that very melancholia."
"I am trying to address an abyss of sorrow, a noncommunicable grief that at times, and often on a long-term basis, lays claims upon us to the extent of having us lose all interest in words, actions, and even life itself."
"Such despair is not a revulsion that would reply only being capable of desire and creativity, negative indeed but present."
"Within depression, if my existence is on the verge of collapsing, its lack of meaning is not tragic-it appears obvious to me, glaring and inescapable."
"Out of what eerie galaxy do its invisible, lethargic rays reach me, pinning me down to the ground, to my bed, compelling me to silence, to renunciation?"
"The wound I have just suffered, some setback or other in my love life or my profession, some sorrow or bereavement affecting In relationship with dose relatives-such are often the easily spotted triggers of my despair."
"A betrayal, a fatal illness, some accident or handicap that abruptly wrests me away from what secerned to le the normal category of normal people or else falls on a one with the same radical effect, or yet..."
An infinite number of misfortunes weigh us down every day...
All this suddenly gives me another life.
"A life that is unlivable, heavy with daily sorrows, tears held back or shed, a total despair, scorching at tünes, then wan and empty."
"In short, a devitalized existence that, although occasionally fired by the effort I snake to prolong is ready at any moitlent for a plunge into death."
"Absent from other people's meaning, alien, accidental with respect to naive happiness, I owe a supreme, metaphysicallucidity to my depression."
"On the frontiers of life and death, occasionally I have the arrogant feeling of being witness to the meaninglessness of Being, of revealing the absurdity of bonds and beings."
"My pain is the hidden side of my philosophy, its mute sister."
"Nevertheless, the power of the events that create my depression is often out of proportion to the disaster that suddenly overwhelms me."
"The depressed person is a radical, sullen atheist."
"While it is true that the French Middle Ages rendered sadness by means of delicate tropes, the Gallic, renascent, enlightened tone tended toward levity, eroticism, and rhetoric rather than nihilism."
"Pascal, Rousseau, and Nerval cut a sorry figure--and they stand as exceptions."
"One must, however, goback to Aristotle to find a thorough reflection on the relationship philosophers have Itlaintained with melancholia."
"This Greek notion of melancholia refrains alien to us today; it assures a properlyly balanced diversity"" euratoms anomaly) that is Metaphorically rendered by froth pross)) the euphoria counterpoint to black bile."
"With Aristotle, melancholia, counterbalanced by genius, is coextensive with man's anxiety in Being."
It could beseen as the forerunner of Heideggers anguish as the Stimmung of thought.
"Christian theology, on the other hand, considered sadness a sin."
"N nevertheless, Medieval monks did promote sadness: as mystical ascesis (acedia ) it became essential as a means toward paradoxical knowledge of divine truth and constituted the major touch tone for faith."
"Changing in accordance with the religious climate, Melancholia asserted itself, if I Ina say so, in religious doubt."
"While it is true that an unemployed worker is less suicidal than a does er ted lover, melancholia does assert itself in times of crisis; it is spoken of, establishes its archeology, generates its representations and its knowledge."
Until death strikes or suicide becomes imperative for those who view it as final triumph over the void of the lost object...
"When the two phenomena, despondency and exhilaration, are of lesser intensity and frequency, it is then possible to speak of neurotic depression."
"While acknowledging the difference between melancholia and depression, Freudian theory detects everywhere the same impossible mourning Jor the maternal object."
Question: impossible on account of what paternal weakness?
A dangerous crossing that needs tobe another relationship that needs tobe thought up?
"These bonds, language in particular, prove to be unable to insure, within the melancholy/depressive composite, the autostiinulation that is required in order to initiate given responses."
"Instead of functioning as,~ ""rewards sister,"" language, on the contrary, hyperactivates the ""anxiety-punishment"" pair, and thus inserts itself in the slowing down of thinking and decrease in psychoitlotor activity characteristic of depression."
"Consequently, the analysis of depression involves bringing to the fore the realization that the complaint against oneself is a hatred for the other, which is without doubt the substratum of an unsuspected sexual desire."
"Better fragmented, torn, cut up, swallowed, digested... than lost."
"Persons thus affected do not consider themselves wronged but afflicted with a fundarrlental flaw, a congenital deficiency."
Their sorrow doesn't conceal the guilt or the sin felt because of having secretly plotted revenge on the ambivalent object.
"Their sadness would be rather the most archaic expression of an unsyrnbolizable, unnameable narcissistic wound, so precocious that no outside agent (subject or agent) can be used as referent."
"For such narcissistic depressed persons, sadness is really the sole object; more precisely it is a substitute object they become attached to, an object they carne and cherish for lack of another."
"Consequently, for such person, no erotic object could replace the irreplaceable perception of a place or preobjeet confining the libido or severing the bonds of does ire."
"Knowingly disinherited of the Thing, the depressed person wanders in pursuit of continuously disappointing adventures and loves; or else retreats, disconsolate and aphasia, alone with the unearned Thing."
"Primary identification initiates a compensation for the Thing and at the same time secures the subject to another dimension, that of imaginary adherence, reminding one of the bond of faith, which is just what disintegrates in the depressed person."
"I have assumed depressed persons tobe atheistic-deprived of cleaning, deprived of values."
It is to this fringe of strangeness that they devote their tears and jouissance.
"Unbelieving in language, the depressive persons are affectionate, wounded to be sure, but prisoners of affect."
"The Thing is inscribed within us without memory, the buried accomplice of our unspeakable anguishes."
One can imagine the delights of reunion that a regressive daydream promises itself through the nuptials of suicide.
"The of the summons up the subjectss life force as that subject is in the process of being set up; the prelature being that we aB are ean survive if it dings to an other, perceived as suppleltlent, artificial extension, protective wrapping."
"Never is the ambivalence of drive store fcarsoltle than in this beginning of otherness where, lacking the filter of language, cannot inscribe any violence in ""no,"" nor in any other sign."
"Banality is summoned during the process of setting up this Thing, one that is our own and proper Thing as touch as it is improper, under."
"For those who are depressed, the Thing like the self is a downfall that carries there along into the invisible and unnameable."
In the attendance of sexuality it constitutes sadist.
"Or is it, on the contrary, implicitly erotic?"
"This would mean that the melancholy withdrawal would always be an overturning of the object relation, a metamorphosis of the hatred against the other."
"Following upon the deflection of the death drive, the depressive collect can be interpreted as a defense against parading."
"The depressive rood constitutes itself as a narcissistic support, negative to be sure, n but nevertheless presenting the self with an integrity, nonverbal though it Night be."
"Because of that, the depressive affect snakes up for symbolic invalidation and interruption (the depressive' s ""that' s Meaningless"") angel at the sale tüne protects it against proceeding to the suicidal get."
"That protection, however, is a flimsy one."
"Depression, on the other hand, does without the schizoid anguish of fragmentation."
"But if depression is not fortunate enough to rely on a certain erotizatioll of sullerill/?, it cannot act as a defense against the death drive."
"The speaking subject can thus react to trouble not only through defensive parceling but also through slowing downinhibition, denial of sequentiality, neutralization of the signifier."
some imrnaturization or other neurobiological features tending toward nonintegration stay condition such behavior.
Depressed persons do not defend themselves against death but against the anguish prompted by the erotic object.
"Depressive persons cannot endure Eros, they prefer tobe with the Thing up to the limit of negative narcissism leading them to Thanatos."
They are defended against Eros by sorrow but without defense against Thanatos because they are wholeheartedly tied to the Thing.
"Messengers of Thanatos, Melancholy people are witness/accomplices of the signifiess flimsiness, the living being's precariousness."
"Less skillful than Melanie Klein in presenting a new repertory of drives, the death drive in particular, Freud nevertheless seems drastic."
"As he sees it, the speaking being, beyond power, desires death."
"At this logical extreme, desire no longer exists."
Desire becomes dissolved in a disintegration of transmission and a disintegration of bonds.
W would the death drive be the primary (logically and chronologically) inscription of that breakdown?
"Sadness is the fundamental mood of depression, and even if tunic euphoria alternates with it in the bipolar forms of that ailment, sorrow is the major outward sign that gives away the desperate person."
"The exact status of such psychic representations of energy displacements remains, in the present state of psychoanalytic and semiological theories, very vague."
"No conceptual framework in the relevant sciences (particularly linguistics) has proven adequate to account for this apparently very rudimentary representation, presign and prelanguage."
"The ""sadness"" rood triggered by a stimulation, tension, or energy convict within a psychosomatic organisrrl is not a specific answer to a release mechanical (I arn not sad as a response to or sign for X and only X)."
"Mood is a ""generalized transference"" (E."
Jacobson) that stands the entire behavior and all the sign systems (from floor functions to speech production and idealization) without either identifying with them or disorganizing them.
"We are justified in believing that an archaic energy signal is involved, a phylogenetic inheritance, which, within the psychic space of the human being, is immediately assumed by verbal representation and consciousness."
"Nevertheless, such an ""assumption"" is not related to what occurs when the energies that Freud calls ""bonded"" lend themselves to verbalization, association, and judgment."
"Thus roods are inscriptions, energy disruptions, and not simply raw energies."
"They lead us toward a modality of significance that, on the threshold of bioenergetics stability, insures the preconditions for (or manifests the disintegration oi) the imaginary and the symbolic."
"On the frontier between animality and symbol formation, Itloods-and particularly sadness-are the ultimate reactions to our trains, they are our basic hoitleostatic recourse."
"It transposes affect into rhythms, signs, forms."
"The supporting father of such a symbolic triumph is not the oedipal father but truly that ""imaginary father,"" ""father in individual prehistory"" according to Freud, who guarantees primary identification."
"Is Death Nonrepresclltable? posited that the unconscious is ruled by the pleasure principle, Freud very logically postulated that there is no representation of deathin the unconscious."
"Just as it is unaware of negation, the unconscious is unaware of death."
"Synonymous with absence of jouissancc, imaginary equivalent of phallic dispossession, death could not possibly beseen."
"It is, perhaps, for that very reason that it opens the way to speculation."
"Unknown to the unconscious, it is, with the ""second Freud,"" a ""cultivation of the superego, "" as one right put it in turning Fraudss phrase around."
"More basically, however, does not such a splitting cut across all discourse?"
"That is what one deciphers in the blanks of discourse, vocalizations, rhythms, syllables of words that have been devitalized and need to be restored by the analyst on the basis of an apprehended depression."
"Thus, if the death drive is not represented in the unconscious, must one invent another level in the psychic apparatus where-simultaneously with jouissance--the being of its nonbeing would be recorded?"
"It is indeed a production of the split ego, made up of fantasy and fiction in short, the level of the imagination, the level of writingwhich bears witness to the hiatus, blank, or spacing that constitutes death for the unconscious."
Dissociation of Forms Imaginary constructions change the death drive into criticized aggression against the father or terrified loathing of the anothers body.
"The fact remains that another reading of the unconscious itself might locate within its own fabric, such as certain dreams disclose it for us, that nonrepresentative spacing of representation that is not the sign but the index of death drive."
The horror of castration underlying the anguish of death undoubtedly accounts in large part for the universal partnership with death of the penis-lacking feminine.
"Nevertheless, the death drive hypothesis cornels a different reasoning."
"In order to protect Another I kill niysclf while knowing-phantasrnatic and protective knowledge-that it Clothes frown her, the death-bearing she-gehenna..."
"No, it is She who is death-bearing, therefore I do not kill myself in order to kill her but I attack her, harass her, represent her..."
"Furthermore, the new techniques of artificial reproduction endow the female body with unsuspected reproductive possibilities."
"In his phylogenetic rousing, Freud often admires the intellectual accomplishment of the man who has been (or when he is) deprived of women (through glaciation or tyranny on the part of the father of the primal horde, et.)."
"When this process is favorably carried out, it is evidenced by the precocious awakening of girls, their intellectual performances often more brilliant during the school years, and their continuing ferule maturity."
"Nevertheless, it has its price in the constant tendency to extol the problematic returning for the lost object... not so fully lost, and it remains, throbbing, in the ""crypt"" of feminine ease and maturity."
"Faced with the impossibility of concatenating, they utter sentences that are interrupted, exhausted, cone to standstill."
The Shattered Concatenation: A Biological Hypothesis Inconsolable sadness often conceals areal predisposition for despair.
"The rhythm of overall behavior is shattered, there is neither time nor place for acts and sequences tobe carried out."
"If in the nondepressive state one has the ability to concatenate, depressive persons, in contrast, riveted to their pain, no longer concatenate and, consequently, neither act nor speak."
Many models have been suggested in order to think out the processes underlying the depressive retardation state.
"One of them ""learned helplessness,"" is based on the following observation: when all escape routes are blocked, animals as well as men learn to withdraw rather than flee or fight."
"The retardation or inactivity, which one might call depressive, would thus constitute a learned defense reaction to a deaden situation and unavoidable shocks."
"According to another model, all behavior would be governed by an autostimulation systerrl, based on reward, that would condition the inception of responses."
One succeeds in putting forward a dual explanation for the disturbance.
"Since the intensification structure, the telencephalon's median network, having a noradrenergic transmission role, is responsible for the response, the depressive retardation and withdrawal would be caused by its dysfunctioning."
Antidepressive treatment would then call for a noradrenergic increase and a serotinergic decrease.
"The La receives innervation directly frown pain pathways throughout the body, and the La shows sustained responses to repeated presentations of ""noxious"" stimulate even in anesthetized animals...."
"If: on the contrary, the symbolic dimension proves tobe insufficient, subjects find themselves back at the deaden of a helplessness leading to inaction and death."
"Within that perspective, several points are still undear."
"Is it conditioned by a dysfunction of the neuronal and endocrinal network that underlies (but in what fashion?) psychic representations and, particularly, word representations, and also the channels that link then to hypothalarnie nude?"
Or still is it an inadequacy of symbolic irnpaet that would be due merely to the fancily and social environment?
"Without exuding the first hypothesis, the psychoanalyst will be concerned with shedding light on the second."
"Finally, numerous illnesses-and depressions-whose origins can be traced to neurophysiological disturbances triggered by symbolic breakdowns remain set in registers that cannot be affected by language."
"The facilitating effect of antidepressants is then required in order to reconstitute a minimal neurophysiological base upon which psychotherapeutic work can begin, analyzing symbolic deficiencies and knots and reconstituting a new symbol sister."
"And yet there is nothing today that allows one to setup any relation whatsoever-aside from a leap-between the biological substratum and the level of representations} be they tonal or syntactic, emotional or cognitive, semiotic or symbolic."
"While remaining heedful of such interferences, they will confine themselves to the specific dunes of depressive discourse as well as to the construction of their own consequent interpretative words."
"If I did not agree to lose another, I could neither imagine nor name her."
"Our gift of speech, of situating ourselves in tire for another, could exist nowhere except beyond an abyss."
"Speaking beings, from their ability to endure in time up to their enthusiastic, learned, or simply amusing constructions, demand a break, a renunciation, an unease at their foundations."
"The negation of that fundamental loss opens up the mean of signs for us, but the Itlourning is often incomplete."
"It seeks to become alien to itself in order to discover, in the mother tongue, a ((total word, new, foreign to the language"" mallarmée), for the purpose of capturing the unnameable."
"Until the weight of the original Thing prevails, and aB translatability become impossible."
"Or else it is from the very beginning evasive, uncertain, deficient, quasi autistic: ""one"" speaks to you already convinced that the words are wrong and therefore ""one"" speaks carelessly, ""one"" speaks without believing in it."
"Meaning, however, is arbitrary; linguistics asserts it for all verbal signs and for all discourse."
"Is not the signifier Law completely unmotivated with respect to the reading of ""laugh,"" and also, and above ab, with respect to the act of laughing, its physical production, its intrapsyehie and interjectional value?"
"Here is the evidence: I call the same meaning and get fire in French, smeyatsya in Russian, and so forth."
"Now every ""normal"" speaker learns to take that artifice seriously, to cather it or forget it."
What Should Be Understood by Denial and Negation?
"Negation will be understood as the intellectual process that leads the repressed to representation on the condition of denying it and, on that account, shares in the signifiess advent."
"Nonetheless, any conception notifies the object of the denial."
"The denial of the signifier is shored up by a denial of the father's function, which is precisely to guarantee the establishment of the signifier."
"Maintained in his function of ideal father or imaginary father, the depressive's father is deprived of phallic power, now attributed to the mother."
"Attractive or seductive, fragile and engaging, such a father holds the subject within suffering but does not allow the possibility of a way out by means of idealizing the symbolic."
I deer negativity tobe coextensive with the speaking being's psychic activity.
"There is no ""symbolic without splitting, and verbal ability is potentially a bearer of fetishism (if only that of symbols themselves) and psychosis (even when remitted)."
"Nevertheless, the various psychic structures are diversely by the negativity process."
If repudiation (verwerjimg) were to prevail over negation the symbolic would collapse and erase reality itself: that is the pattern of psychosis.
"The melancholy person who can go as far as repudiation (rrlelancholy psychosis) is, during the illness' mild development, characterized by the prevalence of denial over negation."
"The semiotic foundations (affect and drive representatives of loss and castration) underlying linguistic signs are denied, and the intrapsychic value of the latter for creating sense for the subject is consequently annihilated."
Depressed people know that their moods determine them thoroughly but do not allow such moods to pass into their speech.
They know they suffer because they are separated floral their narcissistic brotherly coating but ceaselessly rrlaintain their omnipotence over a hell that is not tobe lost.
"They know their mothers have no penis and sign, from the reverent as we as from the tic) inscriptions and decolorizes all three."
At the narcissistic level splitting maintains the omnipotence at the sale tüne as the destructiveness the guise of annihilation.
At the level of oedipal desire it wavers between the fear of castration and the fantasy of phallic omnipotence for the other as for the self.
Everywhere denial effects splittings and devitalizes representations and behaviors as well.
"They keep then, but the signs seem absurd, delayed, ready to be extinguished, because of the splitting that affects them."
The only traces of object constancy that depressive people Maintain are in affects.
"Such acts and relations with partial objects preserve the subject and its object filmn total destruction and provide, with narcissistic homeostasis, a vitality that thwarts Thanatos."
The weakness of the fantasy that is supplanted by eating out bears witness to the continuousness of the denial of the signifier at the level of mental operations in perversions.
That feature is at one with the synlbolie weakness as experienced by depressive persons as web as plane excitement through gets that before wild only if they are deleted insignificant.
The latter can therefore be mobilized to oppose emptiness and hatred.
"Such affective pain, resulting front denial, is then ing Luithollt signification) but it is used as a shield against death."
"Thus the denial of negation that was seen tobe central to the avoidance of the ""depressive position"" with depressed persons does not necessarily endow that affection with perverse coloring."
"The depressed are nonconscious perverts; it is even to their advantage tobe nonconscious, for their taking action, which no symbolization appears to satisfy, can be so paroxysmal."
"True, the delights of suffering can lead to a noose suffering not unfamiliar to monks and that Dostoyevsky, doser to us in time, has exalted."
"It is mainly in its manic phase, characteristic of bipolar forms of depression, that denial takes on its fun strength and appears in broad daylight."
"Admittedly, it has always been there, but secretly: as sorrow's underhanded, consoling companion, the denial of negation constructed a dubious reading and turned dismal language into an unbelievable secerning."
It called attention to its existence in the detached speech of depressed persons who have at their disposal a trick they do not know how to handle: beware of still waters and overly obedient children...
"With panic persons, however, denial goes beyond the double repudiation that supports sadness: it walks on stage and becomes the tool that builds a shield against loss."
"Aesthetic exultance, rising by means of ideal and artifice above ordinary constructions suitable to the standards of natural language and trivialized social code, can partake of this manic activity."
"Hence such a fiction, if it isn'tt an antidepressant, is at least a survival, a resurrection..."
Arbitrary or Empty Persons in despair become hyperacid by nullifying negation.
"A signifying sequence, necessarily an arbitrary one, will appear to them as heavily, violently arbitrary; they will think it absurd, it will have no meaning."
"No word, no object inreality will be likely to have a coherent concatenation that will also be suitable to a meaning or referent."
The arbitrary sequence perceived by depressive persons as absurd is coextensive with a loss of reference.
"The depressed speak of nothing, they have nothing to speak of: glued to the Thing rests)) they are without objects."
"That total and unsignifiable Thing is insignificant-it is a mere Nothing, their Nothing, Death."
The Chaste that settles in between subject and signifiable objects is translated into the impossibility for concatenations to signify.
"Such an exile, however, reveals a chasm in the very subject."
"On the one hand, objects and signifies, denied to the extent that they are identified with life, assume the value of unmeaning: language and life have no meaning."
Denial of negation deprives the language signifies of their role of nuking sense for the subject.
That is because they are not bound to scoliotic imprints (drive-related representatives and affect representations).
"It follows that such archaic psychic inscriptions, one they are set free, can be used in projective identification as quasi-objects."
"The surge of mood, up to the stupor that invades the body, is return of acting out upon the very subject: such overwhelming blood is an action that is not taken on account of the denial that involves the signifier."
Such strategies are real counterdepressant reserves that the optical station within analysis places at the disposal of the depressive patient.
At the value considerable empathy is required between the analyst and the depressed patient.
"This is an infi-aand translinguistic level that lust often be taken into consideration and linked with the ""secret"" and the unvalued affect of the depressive."
"In the best of cases, speaking beings and their language are like one: is not speech our ""second nature""?"
"In contrast, the speech of the depressed is to them. like an alien skin; melancholy persons are foreigners in their maternal tongue."
They have lost the meaning-the value-of their other tongue for want of losing the luther.
"The dead language they speak, which foreshadows their suicide, conceals a Thing buried alive."
As one flees suffering by throwing oneself headlong into a job that is as successful as it is unsatisfactory.
"The abyss that, with depressive persons, separates language from affective experience reminds one of a precocious narcissistic trauma."
"It right have drifted into psychosis, but the superego's protection has in fact stabilized it."
A rather unusual intelligence and secondary identification with paternal or symbolic agency have contributed to that stability.
I may have interpreted those words as a hysterical revisal of the castrating exchange with me.
"On the contrary', thee objectt is as (I' buried-and dominated-bl' jealously' kept treatss, finally concealed il vocalizations."
"Upon resuming from a vacation in Italy, Alme related a dream to me."
"There was a trial, like [klaus] Barbie's trial: I handled thee prosecution, everyone was collvineed."
The torso is undoubtedly)' her own but is coiled up with her mother's in the passion of unconscious juntas)'; two torsos that didn't touch when Anne was a baby and now unwind in a rage words during the two womens quarrels.
"She-io-wants to be born through analysis, to give herselfanother body."
"Buttoned without verbal representation toher mother' s torso, she cannot name that desire, she does not grasp the significance of that desire."
"Now, if one does not know the significance of desire, this means that one is without that very desire."
"It means one is the prisoner of a.ffect, of the archaic Thing, of the primary inscriptions of affects and emotions."
That is precisely where ambivalence holds sway and hatred jor the mother-thing is at once changed into selfdepreciation...
Anne went onto confirm my interpretation: she abandoned the manic problematic of torture and persecution in order to speak of the source of her depression.
"It is coextensive with the cognitive hyperacidity of depressed persons, but also with the manic-depressive's inability to decide or to choose."
"An overinflated, hyperbolic past fills ail the dimensions of psychic continuity."
"Such a fancy for ephemeral mleinory is also undoubtedly a Means for capitalizing on the narcissistic object, of brooding over it within the enclosure of an witless personal vault."
"A dweller in truncated tire, the depressed person is necessarily a dweller in the imaginary reality."
Primary process see govern that expression of archaic domination.
"Omnipotent meaning The subject of a meaning is already there, even if the subject of linguistic signification has not yet been constructed and awaits the depressive position in order to come into being."
It will be recalled that separation from the object starts the so-called depressive phase.
"Or else, still, the child discovers a compromise in denial of the negation, which generally leads to working through mourning by establishing a symbolic system (particularly language)."
The subject then freezes his unpleasant affects like all others and preserves them in a psychic inside thus constituted once and for all as distressed and inaccessible.
It is precisely at this place that psychoanalytic treatment cones in.
"The Western Fate of Conveyance To posit the existence of a primal object, or even of a Thing, which is tobe conveyed through and beyond a completed mourning-isn't that the fantasy of a melancholy theoretician?"
"Certainly the primal object, the ""in-itself' that always remains to be conveyed, the ultimate cause of eonveyability, exists only for and through discourse and the already constituted subject."
"Because what is conveyed is already there, the conveyable ean be imagined and posited as in excess and incomrrlensurable."
"Positing the existence of that other language and even of another of language, indeed of an outside-of-language, is not necessarily setting up preserve for metaphysics or theology."
"The postulate corresponds to a psychic requirement that Western metaphysics and theory have had, perhaps, the good luck and audacity to represent."
"Metaphysics, and its obsession with conveyability, is a discourse of the pain that is stated and relieved on account of that very stateltlent."
"It is possible to be unaware of, to deny the primal Thing, it is possible to be unaware of pain to the benefit of signs that are written out or playful, without innerness and without truth."
"The advantage of those civilizations that operate on the basis of such a model is that they are able to mark the immersion of the subject within the cosmos, its mystical immanence with the world."
"But, as a Chinese friend recognized, such a culture is without means for facing the onset of pain."
Is that lack an advantage or a weakness?
"Westerners, on the other hand, are convinced they ean convey the mother-they believe in her) tobe sure, but in order to convey her, that is, to betray her, transpose her, be free of her."
"Such melancholy persons triuitlph over the sadness at being separated front the loved object through an unbelievable effort to master signs in order to have there correspond to primal, unnameable, traumatic expenenees."
What one notices there is the alternation between depression and anxiety} depression and perverse action} loss of objectt and meaning of speech and sadomasochistic domination over them.
This mayans reveal an aspect of feminine sexuality: its addiction to the maternal Thing and its lesser aptitude jör restorative perversion.
"Nothing, that is, aside from frequent instances of serious depression that did not seen triggered by the current reality, a rather prosperous one, of Helens life."
"When she later tried to find words to describe it, she spoke of states of artificial weightiness, of swept-out dryness, of absence against a backdrop of dizziness, of emptiness cutout into black lightning..."
The reality and fiction of death's being. and artifice.
"An absolute impotence that was, nevertheless, secretly all powerful."
"Such lethal flood could settle down fordays and weeks on end, allowing neither interest in nor access to any exteriority."
"Putting those aliens to death was then a substitute for being dead, and the lethal flood changed into torrents of anguish."
"N nevertheless, it was anguish that kept Helen alive."
"Certainly painful and insufferable, anguish just the sarre gave her access to an extent of reality."
The faces tobe killed were Mainly the faces of children.
"That unbearable temptation horrified her and gave her the impression of being monstrous, and yet being-errlerging out of nothingness."
Faces of the disabled child that she was and henceforth Illustrations wanted tobe finished with?
"Beyond the grave, Proserpina survives as a blind shade."
"Her body is already elsewhere, absent, a living corpse."
"It often happens that she does not feed it or else, on the contrary, she stuffs it the better to get rid of it."
"Through her fuzzy, tearinisted gaze that sees neither you nor herself, she savors the bitter sweetness of being forsaken by so many absent ones."
"At the start of her analysis Helen was warring with her ltlother-inhuman, artificial, nymphomaniac, incapable of any feeling, and having thoughts only, so said the patient, for lionel or for seduction."
"I am sitting on Someone who holds me, perhaps on her lap, but actually it isn'tt anybody."
"A person would have a a voice, a glance, a head."
"It was ghastly."" Orally assimilating the mother who gets married, who has a man, who flees."
"Possessing her, holding her within oneself so as never to be separated from her."
"They are going to go through me, of course, but that isn'tt what frightens me."
"It's strange, I have the feeling Illlistratiolls of Fcminille that going to end up frightflÜly alone."
"And she reeled as she spoke of it, as if she were disconcerted by having to relinquish, if only by words, the object that was imprisoned within herself, and which, if she happened to bliss it, would plunge her into a bottomless grief."
"What is snore, since imagined as monopolizing the jouissance her daughter had given her, but without returning anything in its stead her pregnant), such a mother cloisters frigid woman in an imaginary solitude that is affective as web as sensory."
Two forms ofjouissance thus seem possible for a woman.
On the one hand there is phallic jouissanee-eompeting or identifying with the partner's symbolic power-whieh mobilizes the clitoris.
"On the other hand, there is another jouissance that fantasy imagines and carries outby aiming more deeply at psychic space, and the space of the body aswell."
That other jouissanee requires that the melancholy object blocking the psychic and bodily interior literally be liquefied.
"A partner who gets neither the father's part, ideally rewarding his daughter, nor the symbolic stallion's that one is supposed to obtain through a really competition."
There is no evidence that the other jouissance is absolutely necessary for a womans psychic fulfillment.
"It is a triumph over death, su~~fynot as the individual's ultimate fate, but over the imaginary death where the premature human being is permanently at stake if abandoned, neglected, or misunderstood by the mother."
"I lustra tons The Art Would Be Merely Reprehensible Feminine depression is occasionally concealed by a feverish activity that gives the depressed person the appearance of a practical woman, at ease with herself, who thinks only of being useful."
"It mainly accounts to pouring sleeping drugs and other handful products into coffee, tea, and other drinks that Marianne offers her freely."
"But it also goes as far as slashing her car's tires, disabling the brakes, and so forth."
A kind of rapture seizes Marie-ange when she undertakes such retaliations.
"She forgets her jealousy and her wound and, even though ashamed of what she is doing, she comes dose to feeling gratified."
"Tobe at fault causes her to suffer because being ar fault gives her joy, and vice verse."
"Hurting her rival, disorienting her or even killing her, does that not also amount to inserting herself into the other columnss life, giving her jouissancc unto death?"
"Blank Perversion Loss of the erotic object (unfaithfulness or desertion by the lover or husband, divorce, et.) is felt by the woman as an assault on her geniality and, frown that point of view, amounts to castration."
"At one, such a castration starts resonating with the threat of destruction of the bodys integrity, the body linage, and the entire psychic system as well."
"As a result, feminine castration, rather than being diseroticized, is concealed by narcissistic anguish, which Illustrations masters and eroticism as a shameßtl secret."
"Even though a won't has no penis to lose, it is her entire being - body and especially soul-that she feels is threatened by castration."
Depressive behavior develops on the basis of and within such a void.
"Blank activity, lacking meaning, may just as well follow a deathbearing course (killing the rival who steals the partner) or an innocuous one (wearing herself out doing housework or checking the childrens hom.ework)."
"Only through friendly collusion, free from superego tyranny, does analysis allow shane tobe spoken out and death to find its orbit as the death wish."
Marie-ange's desire to cause (the other's) death so as not to pretend tobe dead (herself) can then be narrated as a sexual desire to joy in her rival or to give her jouissance.
"Melancholias unbounded activity, which is somewhat hypnoidal, secretly cathexes perversion in the most inflexible feature of the law-constraint, duty, destiny, and even the fatality of death."
"The separation henceforth appears no longer as a threat of disintegration but as a steppingstone toward some other-conflictive, bearing Eros and open to both reading and unmeaning."
Don Jeanss Wije-s'orrotv..!ii! or Terrorist Marie-ange has an elder sister and several younger brothers.
"She has always been jealous of that elder sister, the father's favorite, but she retains from her childhood the certainty that she was abandoned by her mother, whose nun successive pregnancies claimed all her attention."
"No hatred toward her sister or her mother seems to have been shown in the past, any more than at present."
"Marie-ange, on the contrary, comported herself like a well-behaved child, sad, always withdrawn."
It took Marie-ange a long tire to talk of her present depressive states.
"Under the surface of the always punctual, busy, and foulness teacher, a woman showed up who Illustrations it to settle for a even to and in this way to wear itself out: that is what one of the and yet indispensable phases of analysis might be."
"The idea of her being ugly, and insignificant did not leave her, but it was snore of an alliance than an idea, nothing obvious, just the glum coloring of a dub day."
"On the other hand, the desire for death, for her own death (for want of avenging herself on the mother) filtered into her phobias: fear of falling out the window, frown the elevator, off a rock, or off the slope of a mountain."
"Fear of finding herself in a void, of dying of the void."
Her life was unharmed at the price of the other's sacrificed life.
The terrorism of such depressive hysteria is often expressed by aiming for the enough.
"Poisoning drink or food nevertheless reveals, beyond the raging sorceress, a lite girl deprived of the breast."
"She often reaches desire by repressing archaic pleasures, even pleasure itself-she yields to heterosexuality in frigidity."
"Marie-ange wants to keep her husband to herself, for herself but not for sexual pleasure."
"Access to jouissance is then effected only through man's perverse object: Marie-ange's pleasure comes front the mistress, and when her husband does not have one he no longer interests her."
"The depressive organss perversion is deceitful, it needs the go-between and screen of man's object-woman in order to seek the other sex."
"But once settled on that path, the tired-out desire of the Melancholy woman knows no bounds: it wants everything, to the end, until death."
"The sharing of that death-bearing secret with analysts is not merely a test of their reliability or of the difference between their discourse and the domain of law, condemnation, or repression."
"Such a trust (""I am having you share in my crime"") is an attempt to win over the analyst into a common jouissance-the one that the mother declined, that the mistress steals."
"By pointing out that the trust is an attempt to gain ascendency over the analyst as erotic object, the interpretation maintains the patient in the truth of her desire and her attempts at manipulation."
"Melancholy rood, with her, amounted only to Mental blanks, evasiveness, distraught and seemingly hallucinated gazing on what may have been grief, but which Isabels superego dignity at once transformed into inaccessible hypertrophy."
"A nothingness that is neither repression nor Siitlply the Nark of the affect but condenses into a black homelikee invisible, crushing, cosmic antimatter-the sensory, sexual, fantasy-provoking ill-being of abandoninents and disappointments."
"Narcissistic wounds and casillustratiolls become into a and irreburden that organizes her subjectivity; within, she is nothing but bruises and paralysis; outside, all that was left toher was acting out or shall activist."
"Isabel needed that ""black hole"" of her melancholia in order to construct her living brotherhood and activities outside it, just as others organize themselves around repression or splitting."
"It was her own thing, her hole, the narcissistic center where she foundered as much as she replenished herself."
Isabel decided to have a child at the darkest moment of one of her depressive periods.
"She had to have a ""reliable companion,"" ""someone who would need me, we would be accolllplices, we would never leave each other, well, almost never.... "" The child conceived as antidote against depression is destined to bear a heavy burden."
The indeed virginal calmness of the pregnant Isabel-no period in her life had ever seemed so euphoria toher asher pregnancy-concealed a bodily tension that any heedful observer would have detected at the beginning of this analysis.
"Isabel did not manage to relax on the couch but, her neck muscles tensed and her feet on the ground (""so as not to damage your belongings,"" she said), she seemed ready to leap forward and confront sole threat or other."
"Illustrations over the fetus, common in most pngrlarlt women, reached a suicidal with Isabel."
"The blue hoped for birth changed into burial, and the vision of the funeral exalted the patient, as if she had desired her child for death alone."
"The brutal stopping of the life she was preparing to give, and of her own as well, was destined to spare her ail worry, to relieve her of the troubles of life."
Birth destroyed the future and the project.
Desire for a child was revealed as narcissistic does ire for lethal fusion-it was a death of desire.
"Thanks to her child Isabel would elude the risks of erotic ordeals, the surprises of pleasure, the uncertainties of the other's discourse."
One she had become a allotter she would be able to remain a virgin.
"Deserting the childs father in order to live as a single Wolllan (or else as an imaginary couple with her analyst?), alone with her daydreams, needing no one and threatened by none, she entered motherhood as one enters a convent."
The depressive mother's selflessness is not without a modicum of paranoid smugness.
"When lite Alive was born, Isabel felt as if she were bombarded by reality."
The babys neonatal jaundice and Illustrations the first childhood illnesses that were venous threatened to change the death into an unbearable fact.
Undoubtedly with the help of Isabel was not swallowed up by postpartum blues.
"Her depressive inclination was transformed into a fierce struggle to save the life of her daughter, whose development she henceforth followed with great tenderness, albeit with the temptation tobe overprotective."
"Smug Abnegation The initial melancholia was devoured by slices's problems."" Nevertheless, without disappearing, it acquired another aspect."
"Ir was transformed into total ascendancy, both oral and anal, over the girl's body, and her development was thus set back."
"Checking Slicess stools until she started school and afterward, her constipation, her diarrhea, giving her enemas..."
Watching over her sleep-what is the normallength of sleep for a two-year-old?
And is not this babble rather an abnormal cry?
As an unwed mother wasn't she responsible for everything?
"Wasn't she all that this ""poor Alice"" had in the world?"
"Her another, father, aunt, grandfather, grandmother?"
"The grandparents, having deemed that this birth was not very orthodox, had stood aloof from the ""virgin mother"" and unwittingly given Isabel an additional excuse in her need tobe all-powerful."
"A depressive person's pride is immeasurable, and this is something one must take into account."
"Isabel, for her part, did not wait that long."
She had the verbal and erotic recourse of transference.
"She could cry and breakdown before her analyst, trying to come to life again not beyond but this time through the returning of the analysis, ready to hear a wounded speech."
"Once solitude has been named, we are less alone if words succeed in infiltrating the spasm of tears-provided they can find an addressee for an overflow of sorrow that had up to then shied away frown words."
Aroused Father and Ideal Father Isabels dreams and fantasies night suggest that she had been the victim of a precocious seduction on the part of her father or some other adult among their acquaintances.
Was this true seduction or desire tobe seduced?
Isabels father appears to love been an Uncoitlmon character.
"And yet this man, aiming at success, had frightful, sudden changes of mood, especially under the influence of alcohol, which he indulged in more and Ignore as he grew older."
Isabels Tother would conceal that emotional instability; at the same time she compensated for it and held it in contempt.
"As far as the child was concerned, such content Infant that mother disapproved of the father's sexuality, his excessive fire, his lack of composure."
"A father, in short, who was both desired and condemned."
"He might have been, to a certain extent, an identifying solution for his daughter, a support in her rivalry with and disappointment in the mother, the genitor who was always distracted by another baby."
"He displayed emotions, passions, and pleasures front the angle of crisis and angerfascinating, but how dangerous and destructive."
"Such excesses, or ""overflows"" as she called them, punctuated the end of her pressive episodes. was as if were drunk, and wards I ended up vacuous."
"But his constant fluctuation between high and low ~ that, I don't want."
"I prefer serenity, stability, sacrifice if you wish."
"The sacrifice formy daughter, however, is it really a sacrifice?"
"Well, a well-tempered joy, like the clavier."" Isabel gave a child to her ideal father-not the father who displayed a drunken body but the fatherr with the absent body, therefore a dignified father, a master, leader."
"The masculine body, the aroused and drunken body, that is the mother's object: Isabel leaves it to that deserting rival, for in the competition with her anothers resulted perversion, the daughter at once admitted she was a minor, a loser."
In becoming the mother and the father Isabel has finally reached an absolute.
"For is it not true that if she does not produce many children, she does everything for a single one?"
"To revel in it at tünes, but also to go beyond it, moving on to another form, not so scorching, more and more perfunctory..."
"Nevertheless, art seems to point to a few devices that bypass complacency and, without simply turning mourning into mania, secure for the artist and the connoisseur a sublimatory hold over the lost Thing."
"First by means of prosody, the language beyond language that inserts into the sign the rhythm and alliterations of semiotic processes."
"Also by means of the polyvalence of sign and symbol, which unsettles naming and, by building up a plurality of connotations around the sign, affords the subject a chance to imagine the unmeaning, or the true meaning, of the Thing."
Is beauty inseparable fran the ephemeral and hence from mourning?
"Or else is the beaugther Realm till the one that tirelessly returns destruction and wars in order to bear witness that there is survival after death, that iinlnortality is possible?"
"Here, however, in the essay ""on Transience,"" by linking the themes of mourning, transience, and beauty, Freud suggested that sublimation might be the counterpoise of the loss, to which the libido so enigmatically fastens itself."
Might the beautiful be the ideal object that never disappoints the libido?
"In the place of death and so as not to die of the other's I bring forth for at least rate artifice, an ideal, a ""beyond"" that only psyche produces in order to take up a position outside itself-ek-stasis."
How beautiful tobe able to replace all perishable psychic values.
"Sublinution's dynamics, by summoning up prünary processes and idealization, weaves a hyperion around and with the depressive void."
"Artifice, as sublime meaning for and on behalf of the underlying, implicit nonbeing, replaces the ephemeral."
"Like feminine finery concealing stubborn depressions, beauty emerges as the adrrlirable face of loss, transforming it in order to make it live."
"It can be so; such beauty is then perishable and vanishes into death, unable to check the artist's suicide, or else fading away floral mlelnory at the very moment of its appearance."
"The grandiosese would even be the impossible dream, the depressive's otherworld, fulfilled here below."
"Outside the depressive space, is the grandiose anything but a gargle?"
The beautiful object that can bewitch us into its world seems to us snore of adoption than any loved or hated cause for wound or sorrow.
"Depression recognizes this and agrees to live within and for that object, but such adoption of the sublime is no Ion ger libidinal."
"It is already detached, dissociated, it has already integrated the traces of death, which is signified as lack of concern, absentmindedness, carelessness."
"The experience of nameable melancholia opens up the space of a necessarily heterogeneous subjectivity, torn between the two co-necessary and copresent centers of opacity and ideal."
Possibility of evil as perversion and of death as ultimate non-nleaning.
"Furthermore, and on account of the meaning maintained during the fading away period, there is the infinite possibility of ambivalent, polyvalent resurrections."
"It endows the lost signifier with a signifying pleasure, a resurrectional jubilation even to the stone and corpse, by asserting itself as coextensive with the subjective experience of a named melancholia-of melancholy jouissance."
"A temporary fetish, allegory does no more than clarify a number of historical and ideological components of the Baroque imagination."
"Whether it reappears as such or vanishes from the imagination, allegory is inscribed in the very logic of the imagination, which its didactic oversimplify has the privilege of revealing ponderously."
"This is a survival of idealization-the imaginary constitutes a miracle, but it is at the same tüne its shattering: a self-illusion, nothing but dreams and words, words, words..."
It affirms the almightiness of temporary subjectivity-the one that knows enough to speak until death corner.
"Hans Holbein the Younger, The Body the Dead Christ in the Tomb."
"I believe that painters are usually in the habit of portraying Christ, whether on the cross or taken down from it, as still retaining a shade of extraordinary beauty on his face, a beauty they strive to preserve even in his moments of greatest agony."
I know that the Christian Church laid it down in the first few centuries of its existence that Christ really did suffer and that the Passion was not symbolical.
His body on the cross was therefore fully and entirely subject to the laws of nature.
"In the picture the face is terribly smashed with blows, stupefied, covered with terrible, swollen, and bloodstained bruises, the eyes open and squinting; the large, open whites of the eyes have a sort of dead and glassy glint."
Here one cannot help being struck by Holbeill's Dead Christ the idea that if death is so horrible and if the laws of nature are so then how ean be overcome?
"How ean they be overcome when even did not conquer them, He who overcame nature during His lifetime and whom nature who said Talitha cumin and the little girl arose, who tried, Lazarus come forth! and the deadman came forth?"
"The picture seems to give expression to the idea of a dark, insolent, and senseless eternal power, to which everything is subordinated, and which controls you in spite of yourself."
"The people surrounding the deadman, none of whom is shown in the picture, must have been overwhelmed by a feeling of terrible anguish and dismay on that evening which had shattered all their' hopes and almost all their' beliefs in one fell blow!."
"They must love parted in state of the most dreadful terror, though each of them carried away within him him a mighty thought which would never be wrested from him."
"And if, on the eve of the crucifixion, the Master could have seen what He would look like when taken from the cross, would he have mounted the cross and died as he did?"
"The right arm is in full view, resting alongside the emaciated, tortured body, and the hand protrudes slightly from the slab."
"The rounded chest suggests a triangle within the very low, elongated rectangle of the recess that constitutes the painting's false."
"Along the various interpretations given by critics, one stands out and seems today the most plausible one."
In the Upper Rhine region there are churches that contain funerary recesses where sculptured Christly bodies are displayed.
Might Holbeins work be a painterly transposition of such recumbent statues?
"According to one hypothesis, this Dead Christ would have been the covering for a sacred tomb open only on Good Friday and closed the rest of the year."
"Finally, relying on Rays of the painting, Fridgef Zschokke has shown that the Dead Christ was initially located in a recess shaped in a semicircle, like the section of a tube."
That location corresponds to the date inscribed next to the right foot and the signature: H.
"On the one hand, we have the birth of a child-and the threat of death weighing on hill but especially on the painter as a father whole the cooling generation would one day displace."
"On the other, there is the friendship with Erasmus and renunciation not only of fanaticism but also, with sole humanists, of faith itself."
From what passion did such a pain arise?
"Would the managed be distressed, that is, haunted by death, because he is sexual, prey to sexual passion?"
"Holbein, on the contrary, leaves the corpse strangely alone."
"It is perhaps that isolation can act of composition-that endows the Holbcinjs Christ the contortion of right hand bearing the the of the seethe whole being bonded by means of a dark of grays, greens, and browns."
"Nevertheless, such realism, harrowing on account of its very parsimony, is emphasized to the utmost through the painting's composition and location: a body stretched out alone, situated above the viewers, and separated frown then."
"Cutoff from us by its base but without any prospect toward heaven, for the ceiling in the recess comes down low, Holbeins Dead Christ is inaccessible, distant, but without a beyond."
"It is a way of looking at mankind from afar, even in death-just as Erasmus saw folly frown a distance."
It is vision that opens out not on glory but on endurance.
"Another, a new morality resides in this painting."
"With no intermediary, suggestion, or indoctrination, whether pictorial or theological, other than our ability to irrlagine death, we are led to collapse in the horror of the caesura constituted by death or to dreary of an invisible beyond."
"Does Holbein forsake us, as Christ, for an instant, had imagined himself forsaken?"
"Or does he, on the contrary, invite us to change the Christly only into a living told, to participate in the painted death and thus include it in our own life, in order to live with it and lake it live?"
"This endowed recess, this well-isolated coffin simultaneously rejects us and invites so Indeed, the corpse fills the entire field of the painting, without any labored reference to the Passion."
"Our gaze follows the slightest physical detail, it is, as it were, nailed, crucified, and is riveted to the hand placed at the center of the Coitlposition."
"Should it attempt to flee it quickly stops, locked in at the distressed face or the feet propped against the black stone."
And yet such walling in allows two prospects.
"Placing the painter's name, to which was often added that of the donor, in that position was Coition at the time."
It is nevertheless possible that in abiding by that code Holbein inserted hirrlself into the drama of the Dead body.
"We have, on the other hand, this hair and this hand that extend beyond the base as if they relight slide over toward US, as if the fraise could not holdback the corpse."
"The rare, precisely, dates from the end of the sixteenth century and includes a narrow edging bearing the inscription Jesus Nazarene Rexjudaeorum, which encroaches upon the painting."
"Even if Holbeins painting had originally been conceived as a predella for an altarpiece, no other panel was added to it."
"In the face of that tradition, which directly preceded hill, Holbein isolated, pruned, condensed, reduced."
Holbeins originality lies then in vision of Christly death devoid of pathos and Intimist on account of its very banality.
Humanization thus reached its highest point: the point at which glory is obliterated by means of graphics.
"When the dismal brushes against the nondescript, the lost disturbing sign is the most ordinary one."
"Contrasting with Gothic enthusiasm, hurnanisrn and parsimony were the inverted products of melancholia."
Gothic expressionism here reached a peak in the exhibition of pain.
"Horizontal lines take the place of the Crucifixion's verticalness, and the corpse appears more elegiac than tragical-it is a heavy, soothed body, dismal in its calm."
"Holbein might simply have inverted the body of Grünewald's dying Christ in placing the feet toward the right and erasing the likeness of the three mourners (magdalene, the Virgin, and John)."
"More sober than the Crucifixion, the Lamentation already suggests the possibility of Gothic art's transition toward Holbein."
With the soles of the feet turned toward the viewers the foreshortened perspective of the corpse Coltlpels recognition with a brutality that verges on the obscene.
"And yet, always heedful of the Gothic spirit, Holbein maintains grief while humanizing it, without following the Italian path of negating pain and glorifying the arrogance of the flesh or the beauty of the beyond."
"According to legend, the corpse of a Jew recovered from the Rhine could have provided Holbein with a Model..."
"It was reproduced and circulated throughout Europe, presenting renascent Mankind with a picture of itself that was both devastating and grotesque, taking up Francois Villons tone by cleans of images."
"Because he acknowledges his folly and looks death in the facet perhaps also because he faces his rental risks, the risks of psychic death-man achieves a new dimension."
"Not necessarily that of atheisrrl but definitely that of a disillusioned, serene, and dignified stance."
"The Protestant Affliction Did the Reformation influence such a concept of death, and snore specifically such an emphasis on Christ's death to the detrirrlent of any allusion to the Redemption and Resurrection?"
"Calvin, on the other hand, insists on the jörmidabilis abyss into which Jesus had been thrust at the hour of his death, descending to the depths of sin and hell."
Luther had already described himself personally as a melancholy being under the influence of Saturn and the devil.
I have learned fran experience how one nest behave during temptation.
"And if the idea of man's generation through grace is tobe found next to that immersion into pain, the fact remains nevertheless that the intensity of one' s faith is geared to one' s ability for contrition."
"Lucas Cranach the Eider because the Protestants' official painter, while Dürer sent Luther series of religious engravings."
"Afterwards he because more and snore reserved about the radical changes proposed in On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church of God, particularly with respect to Luthers thesis according to which human will was slave to God and the devil."
"Reacting against what they thought were the papacys materialistic, paganistic excesses and abuses, the Wittenberg reform.ers sacked churches, pillaged and destroyed images and all Material representations of faith."
"Nothing seems desirable anymore, values collapse, you are morose?"
"Well, that state can be made beautiful, one ean give desirability to the very withdrawal of desire, and as a consequence what might have appeared an abdication or a deadly dejection will henceforth be perceived as harmonious dignity."
some of his drawings display dear choice in favor of a spirit of reform.ation within the Church but without joining the fanaticism of the Reformer himself.
Protestant iconoclasm also left its mark.
"Had the distant, aloof, accomplished ironist become a sort of amoralist out of loathing for any kind of pressure?"
"Was he a devotee of disenchanted non-pressure depressionn], inducing the extinction of all artifice at the heart of a gloomily, scrupulously rrlannered artifice?"
"Appreciated in the nineteenth century, disappointing in the eyes of twentieth-century artists, he shall perhaps come doser to us in the part ironic, part gloomy, part desperate, part cynical light of his Dead Christ."
"Paradoxically, out of this arid spot, out of this desert whence all beauty should be missing, he contacted distress into a masterpiece of colors, forms, spaces..."
"A friend of Erasmus and Thorns More, but subsequently very much at ease with Henry Veii, their fierce, bloodthirsty foe."
"At the heart of a disrupted Europe the quest for moral truth was accompanied by excesses on both sides, while Holbein 's Dead Christ the and rule of strict but one already corruptible by gold."
"At such a world of and fragile truths, the artist refused to cast an embellishing gaze."
Can such a truth also constitute beauty?
"Holbeins wager, beyond melaneholia, is to answer, yes it earl."
Disenchantment transferred into beauty is particularly perceptible in feminine portraits.
"Certainly, the kingdomss tragic history under Henry Veii lends itself to it, but while the people simultaneously feared and adored their king, Holbein retained a gloomy vision of his time."
"It will be noted, nevertheless, that the common feature of those outlays is a detachment-getting rid to it, going elsewhere, abroad, toward others..."
"Isn'tt the artist's life considered, by himself to start with, tobe a work of art?"
"The Death oI Christ A depressive moment: everything is dying, God is dying, I am dying."
Let us briefly return to the evangelical meaning of Christ' s death.
"Theological, hermetic, and doctrinal accounts of the ""mystery of redemption"" are numerous, complex, and contradictory."
"While the analyst cannot accept them, he or she might try, by examining them, to discover the cleaning of the text as it unfolds within his or her hearing."
"His death is neither murder nor evacuation but a life-giving discontinuity, closer to nutrition than to the simple destruction of value or the abandonment of a fallen object."
"A change in the conception of sacrifice obviously takes place within those texts, one that claims to establish a link between men and God through the mediation of a donor."
"This leads one to see in the Christian expiatory ""sacrifice"" the offering of an acceptable and accepted gift rather than the violent ce of shed blood."
"How can we understand it when it is so powerfully asserted alongside the oblatory assurance of an oblatory gift made to a father who is also oblatory, equally present in the Gospels' text?"
"Idea tibia ton break, brief as it might have been, in the bond linking Christ to his Father and to life introduces into the mythical representation of the Subject a fundamental and psychically necessary discontinuity."
It provides image and narrative for some psychic cataclysms that more or less frequently threaten the assured balance of individuals.
"Thus, psychoanalysis identifies and relates as an indispensable condition for autonomy series of splittings (hegel spoke of a ""work of the negative""); birth, weaning, separation, frustration, castration."
"Real, imaginary, or symbolic, those processes necessarily structure our individuation."
"Their nonexecution or repudiation leads to psychotic confusion; their dramatization is, on the contrary, a source of exorbitant and destructive anguish."
It thus endows itself with a tremendous cathartic power.
"The Christly dereliction presents that hell with an imaginary elaboration; it provides the subject with an echo of its unbearable moments when meaning was lost, when the reading of life was lost."
One of these is a compelling one in the analyst's literal reading: the one that suggests an imaginary identification.
Identification does not me an delegating sins or shifting their burholbeiil's Dead Christ to the person of the Messiah.
"On the it calls for a total implication of the subjects in Christ's suffering, in the hiatus he experiences, and of course in his hope of salvation."
"A true initiation is thus elaborated, at the very he art of Christian thought, which takes up again the deep intrapsychic meaning of initiatory rites that were anterior or alien to its domain, and gives them new meaning."
"Here as elsewhere, death-that of the old body ranking doorn for the new, death to oneself for the sake of glory, death of the old man for the sake of the spiritual body-lies at the center of the experience."
"But, if there be a Christian initiation, it belongs first and entirely within the imaginary really."
"While opening up the entire gamut of complete identifications (real and symbolic), it allows for no ritualistic ordeal other than the words and signs of the Eucharist."
"From that standpoint, the paroxysmal and realistic manifestations of asceticism and ""dolor"" are indeed extreme positions."
"Beyond and above that, the implicitness of love and consequently of reconciliation and forgiveness completely transforms the scope of Christian initiation by giving it an aura of glory and unwavering hope for those who believe."
"Christian faith appears then as an antidote to hiatus and depression, along with hiatus and depression and starting front them."
The key to the nexus seems tobe bury identification: the oral and symbolic gift exchanged between Father and Son.
"The only thing then surviving is the meaning of the deeper workings represented by the cross: that of caesura, discontinuity, depression."
"Did Holbein becoltle the painter of such a Christian thought, stripped of its antidepressive carrier wave, and amounting to identification with rewarding beyond?"
"He leads us, at any rate, to the ultimate edge of belief, to the threshold of unmeaning."
"The form (of art) alone gives back serenity to the waning of forgiveness, while love and salvation take refuge to the execution of the work."
Redemption would simply be the discipline of a rigorous technique.
Holbeins Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb is one of the rare if not a unique realization located at the very place of the severance of representation of which Hegel spoke.
"The Gothic eroticism of paroxysltlal pain is missing, just as the promise of the beyond or the renascent exaltation of nature are lacking."
"What remains is the tightrope's the represented body-of an economical, sparing graphic rendition of pain held back within the solitary meditation of artist and viewer."
"To such serene, disenchanted sadness, reading the limits of the insignificant, corresponds a painterly art of utmost sobriety and austerity."
It presents no chromatic or compositional exultation but rather a mystery harmony and Pleasure.
"Is it still possible to paint when desire, which is bond, disintegrates?"
"Holbeins answer is Between classicism and mannerism his minimalism is the metaphor of severance: between and meaning unmeaning, it is an slender response of our melancholia."
"Pascal confirmed, before the sepulcherss invisibility."
"For hill, the tomb would be Christ's hidden abode."
"Everyone looks at hire on the cross but in the tomb he hides from his enemies' eyes, and the saints alone see hire in order to keep hire company in an agony that is peace."
Christ has been shrouded only by saints.
Christ did not perform a single miracle in the sepulcher.
"That is where Christ assures a new life, not on the cross."
It is the final mystery of the Passion and the Redemption.
On earth Christ was able to rest nowhere but in the sepulcher.
But in the tomb at Basel Holbeins Christ is alone.
"Tobe swallowed up by death, or perhaps to see it in its Holbein Dead Christ dreadful as the inherent in life. ((christ in grief..."
"Contemplating the painting might perhaps replace prayer at the critical place of its appearance-where the nonitleaning becomes significant, while death seems visible and livable."
"Like Pascal's invisible only, death is not representable in Fraudss unconscious."
"It is imprinted there, however, as noted earlier, by spacings, blanks, discontinuities, or destruction of representation (see chapter I)."
"Consequently, death reveals itself as such to the imaginative ability of the self in the isolation of signs or in their becoming commonplace to the point of disappearing: such is Holbeins minimalism."
"The self criticizes and signifies the obsessive presence of Death by startling with isolation, emptiness, or absurd laughter its own iitlaginative assurance that keeps it alive, that is, anchored in the interplay of forms."
"To the contrary, images and identities--the carbon co pies of that triumphant welfare imprinted with inacc,essible sadness."
"Our eyes having been filled with such vision of the invisible, let us look one snore at the people that Holbein has created: heroes of modern times, they stand straitlaced, sober, and upright."
"Secretive, too: as real as ean be and yet indecipherable."
Not a single impulse betraying jouissanee.
Nothing but the sober difficulty of standing here below.
"The manuscript of that poem, which belonged to Paul Guard, bears the tide Le Destiny and is essentially the same as the Les Filled du Jet version."
"In August the synlptorns showed up again: there he was, like a threatened archeologist, visiting the osteology wing at the Cardin does Planted, convinced, in the rain, that he was witnessing the Flood."
"Graves, skeletons, the irruption of death indeed continually haunted hill."
"Within such a context, iI Despite Disinherited Poet chad"" was his Noahs Ark."
"Albeit a one, nevertheless secured hire a fluid, enigmatic, spellbinding identity."
"Orpheus, once again, retained victory over the Black Prince."
"This would be previous to the detectable ""object"": the secret and unreachable horizon of our loves and desires, it assumes, for the imagination, the consistency of an archaic mother, which, however, no precise image manages to encompass."
"If the melancholy person ceaselessly exerts an ascendency, as loving as it is hateful, over that Thing, the poet finds an enigmatic way being both subordinate to it and... elsewhere."
"Ta speak, to venture, to settle within the legal fiction known as symbolic activity, that is indeed ta lose the Thing."
"In other words: is it the bacchantes who tear Orpheus to pieces, or is it Orpheus who carries the bacchantes away through his incantation, as in a symbolic anthropophagy?"
"The qualities of that triumphant ""I"" are negative ones; deprived of light, deprived of wife, deprived of solace, he is that which is not."
"Inversions and a Double The qualifier ""saturnine"" nerval's word: fenebreux] is consonant with the Prince of Darkness already suggested by the tarot pack as well as with night deprived of light."
It conjures up the Melancholy person's complicity with the world of darkness and despair.
Would the saturnine mood [he Disinherited be the consequence of his lost a wife?
"At this the Guard adds a note, ""in the Mausoleum?"" which words that have been crossed out, ""the Prince dead/"" or ""the polite."" Mausoleum was the B. c. king of Caria who hurried his sister Artemisia and died before she did."
"While ""inconsolable"" would anchor us in the present, disconsolatee"" turns the present into the past when the trauma was experienced."
He also specified that Brown or Brunt means tower and grain-drying structure.
"There are three instances of the word ablee"" in Nervals work, and Ernie Noble has noted that this uncolnrnon word seemed essential to Mallarmé, who used ir at least six times in his points."
"A dispossessed prince, the glorious subject of a destroyed past, I Desdichado belongs to a history, but to a depreciated his tory."
"The next line again takes up the personal trauma; the tower that has crumbled, the height that is henceforth lacking, was a ""star"" that is now dead."
"The starspangled lute was elaborated through the identification with the ""dead star,"" through scattering her in his song, as in resonant replica of Orpheus' being torn to pieces by the bacchantes."
"This intrusive affect, however, which irrigates the celestial realm with a hidden Apollo, or one who is not conscious of being such, attempts to find its expression."
"The verb ""bears"" points to that bursting out, that reaching the signs of darkness, while the learned word melancholia serves to bespeak the struggle for conscious mastery and precise reading."
"Heralded in Nervals letter to Alexander Dumas, evoked in Aurelia (""A creature of enormous proportions-nlan or Woman I do not know-was fluttering painfully through the air...."
It was colored with ruddy hues and its wings glittered with a myriad changing reflections.
"It changes darkness into redness or into a sun that remains black, tobe sure, but is nevertheless the sun, source of dazzling light."
"Nervals introspection seems to indicate that naming the sun locates hill on the threshold of a crucial experience, on the divide between appearance and disappearance, abolishment and song, unmeaning and signs."
"The haughty, princely ""I"" of passive cosnüc space (the ""star"" and ""sun"" of the first stanza) meets with a partner in the second stanza: a ""you"" appears for the first time, initiating solace, light, and the arrival of plant life."
"The star toilee] of the celestial vault [toit] is henceforth someone the poet ean speak toga ""you"" [toi] who lies within."
"The constant ambiguity, the continuous inversions of Nervals world deserve emphasis; they increase the instability of its symbolism and reveal the objectss ambiguity and also that of the Inelaneholy stance."
"Scholars have asked the question and provided Inane answers-it is Aurelia, the saint, Artemisia Arteritis, Jenny Colon, the dead mother..."
Death then becomes the phantasmal experience of returning to the lost paradise.
"The past tense of ""you who brought me solace"" will be noted."
The virgin Rosalia links the symbolism of feminine Christian purity with the esoteric connotations of the text that have already been mentioned.
"The identification is evoked in the metofthe and leaves, which ""combines"" the grapevine and rose and Moreover evokes Bacchus or Dionysus, god of a plant-loving intoxication, as opposed to the black, astral of the first stanza."
"Let us recall Nervals warning of the Virgin Mary as ""white Rose"" and, among others, ""les Corydalises"": ""where are our lovers?"
They are in the grave I They are far happier I In a more beautiful region!...
"Did such a nüngling of opposites appear to Nerval, as he reread his text, as ""madness""?"
The rhyme leads me once again to read both similitude and opposition between the first two stanzas.
"Mineral sadness (first stanza) is superimposed on a death-bearing merger that is also madly attractive, like the promise of another life, beyond the grave (second stanza)."
"The poet searches, precariously, for his specific identity, on a level one can assume tobe neutral, neither Apollonian nor Dionysian, neither dismayed nor exhilarated."
"The intern * Arcticc is the common French name for a flower of the Aquilegia genus-the columbine, which does not convey the symbolic connotation and rhyme of the French word."
"It is the tire for choice: are we dealing with Cupid, in other words psyche's lover reminderr of the second quatrain), or with Phoebus Apollo reminderr of the first quatrain) who, according to Voidss Metamorphoses) pursued the nymph Daphne?"
She es capes by being changed into a laurel tread one will recall the flowery transformation suggested in the second quatrain.
Is this the case of a gratified lover or a frustrated one?
"As to Lusignan d'agenais, he would be one of the Labrunie's forebears, according to Nervals imaginary filiation, who was crushed by the desertion of his serpentine Messina."
Are we dealing with a listing of more or less unhappy lovers in quest of an always elusive mistress?
"Or with two kinds of lovers, gratified and disheartened?"
"Exegeses pile up and diverge, some favoring the idea of a listing, others the chiasmus."
"Nonetheless, the basic polyvalency of Nervals semantics (thus, among others, ""fair-haired or dark I Must we choose?"
It is not certain that those figures had for Nerval the semantic fullness of their Mythological or medieval source.
"The litaneutical, hallucinatory gathering of their barnes allows one to suppose that they Night rrlerely have the value of signs, broken up and impossible to unify, of the lost Thing."
"With the alcherrlical evocation of the king and queen and their union and redness assign of infancy and reorder (""I sometirrles bear Cain's inexorable redness!""), we are once more steeped in an ambiguous world."
"The powerful Enters of the melancholy person seethes behind a dashing Eros: ""you ask me why my heart is raging so /..."
"The red queen is changed into a siren who swims or ""turns green"" (le Alousquetaire version)."
"Red asserts itself as metaphor of revolt, of insurrectional fire."
"The erotic connection does, in fact, bring to their linux the conflicts of a subject who experiences both sexuality and the discourse that refers toit as destructive."
"Narrate The poet, however, returns front his descent into hell."
"He go es ""twice"" across the Acheron, remaining ""alive"" (le Mousquetaire version) or being a ""conqueror"" (les Filled du feu version), and the two crossings recall the two previous major attacks of madness suffered by Nerval."
"Having assimilated an unnamed Eurydice into his song and the chords of his Tyre, he adopts the pronoun ""I"" as his own."
"Not as strict as in the first line and beyond the uncertainties of the ninth, this ""I"" is, at the conclusion of the sonnet, an ""I"" who narrates a story."
"Besides and even more so, these Women are henceforth sounds borne by characters in a story that narrates a past."
"The ""sighs"" and the ""screams"" connote jouissance, and one distinguishes idealizing love (the ""saint"") from erotic passion (the ""fay"")."
"By means of a leap into the orphic world of artifice (of sublimation), the saturnine poet, out of the traumatic experience and object of mourning, remembers only a gloomy or passional tone."
"He thus comes dose, through the very components of language, to the lost Thing."
"His discourse identifies with it, absorbs it, modifies it, transforms it: he takes Eurydice out of the melancholy hell and gives her back a new existence in his text/song."
"The rebirth of the two, the ""bereft"" and the start""- ""flower,"" is nothing but the poem strengthened by the start of a narrative stance."
"Aurelia is the very instance of a narrative dispersal, replete with dreams, splittings, Innings, incompletion..."
"Just the sale, narrative continuity, which, beyond the certainty of syntax, builds space and tink and reveals the mastery of an existential judgment over hazards and conflicts, is far from being Nervals favorite really."
"Any narrative already assures that there is an identity stabilized by a completed Oedipus and that, having accepted the loss of the Thing, it can concatenate its adventures through failures and conquests of the objectss"" of desire."
"If such be the narrative's internal logie, one ean understand why the telling of a story seels too secondaryy,"" too sehenlatic, too unessential alto capture the blackk sun's"" incandescence with Nerval."
"Prosody will then be the basic, fundamental sieve that will sift the ""black prince's"" sorrow and joy into language."
A fragile filter but often the only one.
"Does one not, when all is said and done, and beyond the multifarious and contradictory meanings of words and synthetic structures, hear the vocal gesture?"
"With the very first alliterations, rhythms, melodies, the transposition of the speaking body asserts itself through a glottic and oral presence."
"We can find out, we find out, interpretations pile up or differ..."
"It can thus be understood that the triumph over melancholia resides as much in founding a symbolic family (ancestor, mythical figure, esoteric community) as in constructing an independent symbolic object sonnet."
"Abandoned by his father who thus renounces his almightiness, Christ dies and drags every creature down into the abyss."
"Children, you no Ion ger have a father!""?"
"Identifying with Christ, the poet appears to suggest it: "" 'no, God does not exist!' / They were asleep. 'friends, have you heard the Disinherited Poet but the shifter of cleaning."
"Thus the sophistication of polytheist knowledge has the ultimate aim of taking us to the threshold of naming, to the edge of the unsymbolized."
He is the continuous historian less of his real history than of the symbolic events that have lead his body toward significance or threatened his consciousness with foundering.
I was wandering about a vast building composed of several rooms....
A creature of enormous proportions-manor won't I do not know was fluttering painfully through the air... it looked like Dürer's Angel melancholia.
"The symbolics of language and, more markedly, the text takes over from terror and triumphs, for a while, through the death of the other or of the self."
"Figures follow one upon another, Inept, pursue or love one look after, reject one another."
"Brothers, friends, or enemies, doubles might be involved in a true dramatic staging oE homosexuality."
"Aurelia, ""a swollen worn I had loved for a long while,"" is dead."
"But ""I said to myself: 'I am being warned of either her death or Nine'!"" upp."
"Having found Aurelias funereal bust, the narrator re counts the Melancholy state caused by the knowledge of his illness: ""I believed that I Myself had only a short while Ion ger to live...."
"She and he, life and death, here are entities that reflect each other in Inirrorlike fashion, interchangeable."
"After evoking the process of creation, prehistoric animals, and various cataclysms (""everywhere the suffering linage of the eternal Mother was dying, weeping, or languishing""; p."
"It is an oriental prince whose face is that of the narrator: ""it was In own face, my whole fond magnified and idealized"" (p."
"Because he is being visited by this bad double, by ""an evil genius (who] had In place in the soul world,"" Aurelias lover gives into a greater despair."
"To crown it all, he engines that his double ""was going to marry Aurelia"" - ""immediately a mad rage seized nice,"" while all around hire they laughed at his impotence."
"As a result of this dramatic doubling, women' s screams and foreign wordsother signs of doubling, this time sexual and verbalpierce Nervals dreary (p."
"Meeting, under an arbor, a woman who is Aurelias physic double, he is again thrust into the idea that he must die in order to bewith her, as if he were the dead womans alter ego (p."
Childrens voices were repeating in chorus: Christ!
"Christ!... 'but Christ is no Store,' I said to myself"" (p."
"The narrator descends to hell as Christ did and the text Clones to a stop with that image, as if it were not sure of forgiveness and resurrection."
"The theine of forgiveness asserts itself indeed in the last pages of Aurelia: guilty because he did not mourn for his old parents as strongly as he returned for ""that woman,"" the poet cannot hope for forgiveness."
"Confronting the ""black sun of melancholia"" the narrator asserts, ""god is the Sun"" (p."
"The language of that breathtaking acceleration assumes a combinatory, polyvalent, and totalizing aspect, dominated by primary processes."
"Cabalism or esoteric theories involving ""correspondences"" showup here."
"All the sale, the quotation is also an allegory of the prosodic polymorphism characteristic of a writing in which Nerval appears to favor the network of intensities, sounds, significances rather than communicating univocal information."
"Whatever allusions to freemasonry and initiation there may be, and perhaps at the same time, Nervals writing conjures up (as in analysis) archaic psychic experiences that few people reach through their conscious speech."
"With Nerval, melancholia represented only one aspect of such conflicts, which could reach the point of schizophrenic fragmentation."
"A true melaneholy experience of Inanes Ellen-.n..,,"",- resources was then undergone on the occasion of the religious and political crisis caused by the French Revolution."
"By accepting the dispersal of meaning-the text's replica of a fragmented identity-the themes of the sonnet relate a true archeology of affective mourning and erotic ordeal, overdone by assimilating the archaic state into the language of poetry."
"At the same tüne, the assimilation is also accomplished through oralization and musicalization of the signs themselves, thus bringing meaning closer to the lost body."
Dostoyevsky seems very dose to such an insight.
"As if under the impact of an equally precocious superego that recalls the Itlelancholy superego seen by Freud as a ""cultivation of death drive,"" the drives ofdostoyevsky's heroes turn back on their own space."
"Instead of changing into erotic drives, they are inscribed as a suffering blood."
"Neither inside nor outside, in between, on the threshold of the self/ other separation and before the latter is even possible, that is where Dostoyevskys brand of suffering is setup."
Biographers point out that Dostoyevsky preferred the company of those who were prone to sorrow.
He cultivated it in himself and exalted it in both his texts and his correspondence.
"Just the sale, sorrow is such that if I were alone, I should perhaps have become ill with grief...."
"At any rate sadness is dreadful, and worse yet in Europe, I look at everything here as an animal might."
"No matter what, I have decided to return to Petersburg next spring.... "" Epileptic fits and writing are in the same way the high points of a paroxysmal sadness that revers es into a mystical jubilation outside time."
"Before, it was over in three days, and now it was not over in six."
"One must suffer, suffer a lot.... "" Suffering, here, seems to bean ""excess,"" power, a sensual pleasure."
"The ""black spot"" of Nervals melancholia has given way to a torrent of passion, a hysterical affect if you wish, whose fluid overflow carries away the placid signs and soothed compositions of ""monological"" literature."
It endows Dostoyevskys text with a breathtaking polyphony and imposes as ultimate truth of his characters a rebellious flesh that delights in not submitting to the W or.
"If it las ted more than five seconds, the soul could not endure it and must endure ten seconds one must be physically changed.... don'tt you have fits, perhaps? no. - Well, you will."
Givee heard that's just how [epileptic] fits begin.
And concerning the slow duration of this state: Remember Mahomets pitcher from which not a drop of water was spilt while he circled Paradise on his horse.
"That was a case of five seconds too; that's too much like your eternal harmony, and Mahomet was an epileptic."
"Be careful, it's epilepsy""s Irreducible to feelings, the affect in its twofold aspect of energy flow and psychic inscription-iucid, dear, harmonious, even though outside language--is translated herewith an extraordinary faithfulness."
"The affect does not go through language, and when referring to it language is not bound to it as it is to an idea."
The verbalization of affects (unconscious or not) does not use the same economy as the verbalization of ideas (unconscious or not).
"After all, perhaps man likes something besides prosperity?"
Perhaps he likes suffering just as much?
Perhaps suffering is just as great an advantage to hill as prosperity?
"Suffering would be out of place in vaudeville, for instance; I know that."
"In the crystal palace it is even unthinkable; suffering means doubt, means negation...."
"Nature, through the medium of my consciousness, proclaims to one some sort of cannon of the whole."
"Human consciousness has produced religions out of this message.... abase myself, accept suffering because of the harmony of the whole, and consent to live...."
And why should I bother about its preservation after I no longer existthat is the question.
"It would love been better to be created like all animals. e., living but not conceiving myself rationally."
"But my consciousness is not harmony, but, on the contrary, precisely disharmony, because with it I am unhappy."
An inordinate but checked violence opens onto the execution of the self by itself in order that the subject be born.
One can imagine the masochistic risks of that civility.
"As far as writers are concerned, they can extract jubilation out of it through are able, on that basis, to inflict upon signs and things."
"It can involve an internal or external bioenergetics break or a symbolic one caused by an abandonment, a punishment, a banishment."
"One cannot overemphasize the harshness of Dostoyevskys father who was held in contempt by his ltiuzhiks and perhaps even killed by them (according to some biographers, now disproved)."
"Suffering is the first or the last attempt on the part of the subject to assert his ""own and proper"" at the doses point to threatened biological unit and to narcissism put to the test."
Erotization of suffering seems tobe secondary.
"The subject represses or repudiates the paranoidschizoid violence that, front this standpoint, would be subsequent to the painful psychic inscription of discontinuity."
"It then logically or chronologically regresses to the level where separations as well as bonds (subjeet/object, affect/meaning) are threatened."
"In melancholy persons this stage is revealed by the dorrlinanee of rood over the very possibility of verbalization, before an eventual affective paralysis."
"In this sense forgiveness) coextensive with sublimation, diseroticizes beyond Eros."
"The Eros/forgiveness pair is substituted for Eros/thanatos, so that the potential melancholia is not frozen as an affective withdrawal from the world but traverses the representation of aggressive and threatening bonds with the other."
"Even if that God is ruthless, unjust with the faithful, generous with the ungodly, that does not induce Job to break his divine contract."
"W would suffering persons be narcissistic, overly interested in themselves, attached to their own value, and ready to take themselves for an irnrnanence of transcendence?"
"Likewise, with Dostoyevsky the Christian, suffering major evidence of hununity-is the sign of nanss dependency on a divine Law, as we as of his irremediable difference in relation to that Law."
"The coincidence fond and lapse, of faithfulness and transgression are to be found again on the very ethical plane where Dostoyevskys character is an idiot through holiness, an enlightener through crirninali ty."
"Such a logic postulating interdependence of law and transgression cannot be extraneous to the epileptic fit being triggered by what is very often a strong contradiction between love and hatred, desire for the other and rejection of the other."
"Nevertheless, if the symbolic bond were broken, Job would turn into Kirillov, a suicidal terrorist."
Suffering ceases so that death might assert itself; was suffering adam against suicide and against death?
"Suicide and Terrorism üne will recall at least two solutions, both fatal, to suffering in Dostoyevsky-the ultima te veil of chaos and destruction."
"Kirillov is convinced that God does not exist but, in abiding by divine authority, he wants to raise human freedom to the level of the absolute through the utterly free, negating act that suicide constitutes for him."
"God does not exist am Gold do not exist commit suicidesuch would be the paradoxicallogic of the negation of an absolute paternity or divinity, which is nevertheless maintained so that I might take hold of it."
"With Dostoyevsky, nihilism arouses the believer's revolt against transcendental erasing."
"Such ""obscurantism,"" so violently denounced by Freud, is, aB thing considered, less harmful to civilization than terrorist nihilist."
"With and beyond ideology, writing rernains-a painful, continuing struggle to compose a work edge to edge with the unnameable sensuous delights of destruction and chaos."
"Are religion or mania, daughter of paranoia, the only counterbalances to despair?"
Artistic creation integrates and expends them.
"Works of art thus lead us to establish reladostoyevsky, tons with ourselves and others that are Less destructive, store soothing."
"This bodys death, so natural, so im.placable, seems to leave no root for redemption: ""[christ's] swollen face is covered with bloody wounds, and it is so terrible to behold"" Anna Grigorievna Dostoyevsky wrote in her remmlscences."
The painting had a crushing impact on Floor Mikhailovich.
"And I did not have the strength to look at tit was too painful forme, particularly in my sickly condition-and I went into other rooms."
"When I came back after fifteen or twenty minutes, I found hire still riveted to the same spot in front of the painting."
"His agitated face had a kind of dread in it, something I had noticed more than once during the first moments of an epileptic seizure."
"Quiet I took my husband by the arm, led him to another room and sat hire down on a bench, expecting the attack from one minute to the next."
"With Dostoyevsky, to suspend title orleans to suspend faith in Christ: ""everything thus depends on this: does one accept Christ as the definitive ideal on earth?"
"Merely an abyssal suffering that does not succeed in signifying itself and, having lost meaning, loses life."
"Forgiveness: giving in addition, banking on what is therein order to revive, to give the depressed patient (that stranger withdrawn into his wo and) a new start, and give hire the possibility of a new encounter."
This is also wherefore so than at the place of his imaginary complicity with the criminal-the feeling of discomfort aroused by his texts up in the contemporary reader who is caught up in nihilism.
"Indeed, any modern imprecation against Christianity to and including Nietzsehe's-is an irnpreeation against forgiveness."
"Such ""forgiveness,"" however, understood as connivance with degradation, moral softening, and refusal of power is perhaps only the image one has of decadent Christianity."
"At any rate, that is how it appears under the benevolent inlet of analytic practice."
"An example of this is the path followed by Raskolnikov, who went through melancholia, terrorist negation, and finally gratitude, which proved tobe a rebirth."
"His large, but lustreless eyes, set as they were in blue cares, always stared straight before him, never swerving, and never seeing anything-of that I feel certain...."
What is he thinking about? went on wondering.
And does he still think of anything at all?
"He is an old ran named Split, the grandfather nelly, the lüde epileptic, the father of a ""romantic and unreasonable"" daughter whom he never forgave her relationship with Prince P."
"Valkovsky, a relationship that was to wipe out Wraithss fortune, destroy the young wo man and Nelly herself, the prince's illegitimate child."
"Smith displays the rigid, death-bearing dignity of one who does not forgive."
Snitch forgives neither his daughter nor Valkovsky; Nelly forgives her Another but not Valkovsky; the mother forgives neither Valkovsky nor her own embittered father.
"As in a dance of death, humiliation without forgiveness calls the tune and leads the ""selfishness of suffering"" to sentence everyone to death within and through the narrative."
A hidden message seers to emerge: he who does not forgive is condemned to death.
"The body demeaned by old age, disease, and solitude, all the physical signs of inescapable death, illness, and sadness itself would in that sense point to an inability to forgive."
"Consequently, the reader infers that the ""dead Christ"" himself would be christ viewed as one to whom forgiveness is unknown."
"In order tobe so ""truly dead,"" such christ could not have been forgiven and will not forgive."
"Made insulted, jeered at, even threatened with death by Rogozhin, the prince forgives."
"Mercy finds in hire its literal psychological fulfillment: having suffered too much, he takes upon himself the miseries of others."
"As if he had had an inkling of the suffering that underlies aggressions, he ignores there, withdraws, and even gives solace."
"The scenes of arbitrary violence he is subjected to and that Dostoyevsky evokes with tragic and grotesque power cause hire pain, tobe sure."
"Indeed, it's something they never learned of."
For there are two sorts of mind-one that is essential and one that isn'tt.
"Insults, of course, any literal and physical wound, and, eventually, death."
He does not seen to distinguish the senseless murder from murder as literal punishment imposed by mens justice.
"Dostoyevskys dramatic invagination, his tormented characters, particularly suggest the difficulty, even the impossibility of such forgivenessllove."
Is one bound by the law of the individual on earth?
"From Sorrow to Crime Raskolnikov described horns elf as a sad person: ""listen, Razumuhin..."
"You are the very portrait of hire, and not so much inface as insoul."
How does such sadness becoitle inverted into crime?
"What comes first, hatred or depreciation?"
"Dostoyevskys praise of suffering suggests, as we have seen, that he gives greater place to self-depreciation, self-humiliation, or even a sort of masochism under the stern gaze of a precocious and tyrannical superego."
"Frown that standpoint, crime is a defense reaction against depression: murdering the other protects against suicide."
"Raskolnikov's ""theory"" and criminal act demonstrate that logic perfectly."
"The correlative of the tyrannical and desirable that is to be challenged is but an insignificant thing, a louse."
"The confusion persists, and Dostoyevsky thus brilliantly brings to the fore the identification of the depressed with the hated object: ""the old woman was mistake perhaps...."
"Dostoyevsky considers two antidotes for that catastrophic motion: recourse to suffering, and forgiveness."
"The two movements take place at the same time and, perhaps thanks to an underground, dark revelation, difficult to grasp in the tangle of Dostoyevskys narrative, are nevertheless perceived with sleepwalking lucidity by the artist... and the reader."
"The tracks of that ""illness,"" that insignificant thing or ""louse,"" converge on the despondent student's mother and sister."
"Loved and hated, attractive and repulsive, these women meet the murderer at the crucial moments of his actions and reflections, and, like two lightning rods, draw to themselves his ambiguous passion, unless they be its origin."
But he stood like one dead; a sudden in tolerable sensation struck hün like a thunderbolt.
"He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he could not."
"His mother and sister clasped hire in their ants, kissed hire, laughed and cried."
"He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground, fainting"" (p."
"Yes, I hate there, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can't bear there near le...."
She [his mother] must be the same as I aral....
"In those last words, which he utters in his frenzy, Raskolnikov indeed reveals the confusion between his debased self, his mother, the old murdered woman..."
"The gloomy Raskolnikov is again ready to kill, but this time in order to his sister."
"The Third Way Forgiveness appears as the only solution, the third way between dejection and murder."
"It arises in the wake of erotic enlightenment and appears not as an idealizing movement repressing sexual passion, but as its working through."
"The angel of the paradise reached after the apocalypse is called Sonia, a prostitute out of compassion tobe sure and concern for her unfortunate family, but a prostitute just the same."
"Reconciliation with a loving mother, though she might be unfaithful or even a prostitute, beyond and in spite of her ""lapses,"" thus appears as a condition for reconciliation with one's self."
"The ""self"" finally becomes acceptable because henceforth placed outside the tyrannical jurisdiction of the plaster."
The forgiven and forgiving mother becomes an ideal sister and replaces...
"The humiliated, warring hero can then calm down."
"Imagination is that strange place where the subject ventures its identity, loses itself down to the threshold of evil, crime, or asymbolia in order to work through there and to bear witness... from elsewhere."
"That is sublimation, and it needs forgiving."
"It breaks the concatenation of causes and effects, crimes and punishment, it stays the time of actions."
It does not suggest the Golden Age of ancient mythologies.
"It was this picture that appeared tome in a dream, yet not as a picture but as though it were an actual scene...."
"As in the picture, I saw a corner of the Greek archipelago the way it was some three thousand years ago: caressing azure waves, rocks and islands, a shore in blossom, afar a magic panorama, a beckoning sunset-words fail one."
"European mankind remembers this place as its cradle, and the thought filled my soul with the love that is bred of kinship."
"Here was mankinds earthly paradise, gods descended from heaven and united with mortals, here occurred the first scenes of mythology."
"Oh, how happy I was that my he art was shaken and that at last I loved!"
"The sun poured its rays upon these isles and this sea, rejoicing in its fair children."
"But the cliffs, and the sea, and the slanting rays of the setting sun, all that I still seemed to see when I woke up and opened my eyes, for the first time in my life literally wet with tears...."
And all of a sudden I saw clearly a tiny red spider.
I remembered it at one as it had looked on the geranium leaf when the rays of the setting sun were pouring down in the same way.
It was as if something had stabbed me....
"The scene between Raskolnikov and Sonia, while recalling that of Acis and Galatea because of the pastoral joy and heavenly radiance that imbues it, refers neither to Claude Lorraines work nor to the Golden Age."
"A strange ""golden Age"" indeed, lying at the very heart of hell, in Siberia, near the prisoner's shed."
Sonias forgiveness evokes the narcissistic regression of the incestuous lover but does not merge with it: Raskolnikov crosses the break in loving happiness by plunging into the reading of Lazarus' story frown the New Testament that Sonia lent hire.
"From the high bank a broad lands cape opened before hire, the sound of singing floated faintly audible [rom the other bank."
"Forgiveness does not cleanse actions. lt raises the unconscious from beneath the actions and has it meet a loving other-another who does not judge but he are my truth in the availability of love, and for that very reason allows le to be reborn."
"Forgiveness is the luminous stage of dark, unconscious timelessness-the stage at which the latter changes laws and adopts the bond with love as a principle of renewal both self and other."
Aesthetic Forgiveness One grasps the seriousness of such forgiveness with and through the unacceptable horror.
Its within the tüne of Because am front In unconscious through a new transference to a new other or a new am able to write the dramatic unfolding of my nevertheless unforgettable violence and despair.
"The time of that separation and renewal, which underlies the very act of writing, does not necessarily show up in the narrative timeses, which night reveal only the inferno of the unconscious."
"But it can also display itself through the device of an epilogue, like the one in Crime and Punishment, that stays a novelistic experience before causing it to be reborn by means of another novel."
"The crime that is not forgotten but signified through forgiveness, the written horror, is the requirement for beauty."
"There is no beauty outside the forgiveness that remembers abjection and filters it through the destabilized, musicalized, sensualized signs of loving discourse."
"Forgiveness is aesthetic and the discourses (religions, philosophies, ideologies) that adhere to the dynamics of forgiving precondition the birth of aesthetics within their orbit."
"Forgiveness at the outset constitutes a will, postulate, or scheme: meaning exists."
"This is not necessarily a matter of a disavowal of meaning or a manic exaltation in opposition to despair (even if, in a number of instances, this motion maybe dominant)."
"Forgiveness, as a gesture of assertion and inscription of meaning, carries within itself, as a lining, erosion of meaning, melancholia, and abjection."
"By including them it displaces them; by absorbing them it transforms them and binds them for someone else. ""there is a meaning"": this is an eminently transferential gesture that causes a third party to exist for and through an other."
Forgiveness emerges first as the setting up of form.
"It has the effect of an acting out, a doing, a priests."
"Giving without exegesis, ton, without understanding."
"The of such an action clarifies it has the ability to reach, beyond words and intellects, illations and bruised bodies."
"Whoever is in the realm of forgiveness-who forgives and who accepts forgiveness's capable of identifying with a loving father, an imaginary father, with Who'll, consequently, he is ready to be reconciled, with a new symbolic law in mind."
"It provides perverse, masochistic pleasure ingoing through suffering toward the new bonds constituted by forgiveness as wen as the work of art."
"Contrarily, such notions maybe interpreted as paving the way for the uniqueness of orthodox Christian thought up to the schism of Per Filium/filioque."
"Then you appeared, you, invisible, elusive...."
"It seems to rule, oh Lord, that you, motionless, moved In, you, unchanging, you changed, you, featureless, assumed features...."
"For your own spirit, like your soul, lies within your intellect, and aB your intellect is in all your speech, and all your speech is in aB your spirit, without separation and without confusion."
"On a strictly theological level, it was Sylneon, more so than Photos, who formulated the Eastern doctrine of Per Ilium as opposed to the Latin's Filioque."
"Emphasizing the Spirit, he asserted the identity of life in the Spirit with life in Christ, and he set the origin of that powerful pneumatology within the Father."
"The Borromean knot that Lacan used as metaphor of the unity and the difference between the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbol perhaps allows one to think out this logic, assuming that it is necessary to rationalize it."
"Orthodoxy nurtured it by adoring, beyond oppositions, a sense of fullness where each person of the Trinity was linked to and identified with all others-anerotic fusion."
"For Simeon, the N we Theologian, light was inseparable from the ""painful affection"" (katanyxis) that opened up to God through humility and a Hood of tears, for it knew right away that it was forgiven."
"Moreover, the pneumatic conception of the Eucharist, expounded for instance by Maximus the Confessor (twelfth century), leads one to believe that Christ wasat the same time deified and crucified, that death on the cross is innate in life and living."
"On that basis painters permitted themselves to present Christ's death on the Cross-because death was living, the dead body was an incorruptible body that could be kept by the Church as image and reality."
"Such a subjectivislti, in the light of grace, finds one of its privileged expressions in Christ's Passion: just like man, Christ suffers and dies."
"Scenes from the Passion were added to the traditional liturgical cycle in I at Perez, in a Macedonian church founded by the comment."
The progressiveness of iconography compared with the classical or Judaic tradition was nevertheless to be stalled later on.
"Coming late after the Byzantine expansion and that of the southern Slavs (bulgarians, Serbs), the Russian church intensified its pneumatology and mystie tendencies."
"Pagan, Dionysiac, Eastern, the pre-christian tradition imprinted on the Byzantine Orthodoxy as it passed into Russia a heretofore unattained paroxyslti."
It would be üupossible to understand Dostoyevsky without it.
"The Spoken Forgiveness The writer's position is one of speech: a symbolic configuration absorbs and replaces forgiveness as emotional impulse, mercy, anthropomorphic compassion."
To say that the work of art is a forgiving already implies leaving psychological forgiveness (but without ignoring it) for a singular act-that of naming and composing.
One will thus be unable to understand why art is forgiveness without examining all the levels at which forgiveness functions and is exhausted.
"Nevertheless, and in contrast to divine mercy, which excludes sadness, forgiveness gathers on its way to the other a very hull sorrow."
"Recognizing the lack and the wound that caused it, it fulfills then with an ideal gift -pronlise, project, artifice, thus fitting the humiliated, offended being into an order of perfection, and giving hill the assurance that he belongs there."
"Love, all in all, beyond judgment, takes over from sadness, which is nevertheless understood, heard, displayed."
"It is possible to forgive ourselves by releasing, thanks to someone who hears us, our lack or our wound to an ideal order to which we are sure we belong-and we are now protected against depression."
"How can one be sure, however, of joining that ideal order by going through the lack, without once more negotiating the narrow pass of identification with flawless ideality, loving fatherhood, primitive guarantor of our safeties?"
Writing: Immoral Forgiveness Whoever creates a text or an interpretation is more than anyone else drawn to accept the fully logical and active agency of Thomistic energy beyond emotional effusion.
Writing causes the affect to slip into the ej]ect-actus Plants) as Aquinas might say.
"Because it is forgiveness, writing is transforltlation, transposition, translation."
"From that loment on, the world of signs lays down its own logic."
"Immoralist is the fa te of that process, which Dostoyevsky is we acquainted with: writing is bound to evil not only at the outset (in its pretext, in its objects) but also at the end, in the absoluteness of its universe that excludes all otherness."
"The eternal return of a threefold notion thus gets underway: affection tied to suffering, logical justice and appropriateness of the work, hypostasis, and finally unease over the final, masterful aeconlplishlnent."
"Then, one again, in order to forgive hin s elf, he results the threefold logic of forgiveness..."
"Auschwitz and Hiroshüna have revealed that the maladyy of death,"" as Marguerite Auras might say, informs our lost concealed inner recesses."
"If military and economic realms, as well as political and social bonds, are governed by passion for death, the latter has been revealed to rule even the once noble kingbolt of the spirit."
"Nonetheless, never has the power of destructive forces appeared as unquestionable and unavoidable as now, within and without society and the individual."
"No luitiinous disparity would remain, nothing would distinguish one point in space from another."
"This treltiendous, trapped energy would end up in invisibility, in imperceptible equality."
"Both religious and political, the crisis finds its radical rendering in the crisis of signification."
"Front now on, the difficulty in naming no longer opens onto musicc in literature"" mallarmée and Joyce were believers and aesthetes) but onto illogicality and silence."
"This was pressure that had found its intimate, unavoidable repercussion at the heart of psychic grief."
"It was experienced as an inescapable emergency, without for that matter ceasing to be invisible, nonrepresentable--but in what sense? the gas,-,h'''-uclv'-.l..., gulag?"
"What those monstrous and up.""u.~~.'-'..... do manage to are our systems of perception and representation."
"As if overtaxed or destroyed by too powerful a breaker, our symbolic means find themselves hollowed out, nearly wiped out, paralyzed."
"On the edge of silence the word ""nothing"" enlarges, a discreet defense in the face of so much disorder, both intern aland external, incommensurable."
Never has a cataclysm been more apocalyptically outrageous; never has its representation been assumed by so few symbolic means.
"On the one hand, the art of imagery excelsin the raw display of monstrosity."
"Melancholia becomes the secret mainspring of a new rhetoric: what is involved this time is to follow illuming step by step, almost in clinical fashion, without ever getting the better of it."
"Within this image/words dichotomy, it falls to films to spread out the coarseness horror or the external outlines of pleasure, while literature becomes internalized and withdraws fran the world in the wake of the crisis in thought."
"Mass corrlnlunication arts on the one hand, the expellee."
Auras' writing does not analyze itself by seeking its sources in the music that lies under the words nor in the defeat of the narrative's logic.
"If there be a foul search, it is subordinate to confrontation with the silence of horror in oneself and in the world."
"Such a confrontation leads her to an aesthetics of awkwardness on the one hand, to a noncathartic literature on the other."
The affected rhetoric of literature and even the common rhetoric of every day speech always seen somewhat festive.
"How can one speak thetruth of pain, if not by holding in check the rhetorical celebration, warping it, breaking it grate, strain, and limp?"
"Meanwhile, and perhaps for that very reason, the distorted speech sounds strange, unexpected, and above all painful."
"A difficult seduction drags one into the characters' or the narrator's weaknesses, into that nothing, into what is nonsignifiable in an illness with neither tragic crisis nor beauty, a pain from which only tension remains."
Stylistic awkwardness would be the discourse of dulled pain.
"For such silent or precious exaggeration of speech, for its weakness tensed as if on a tightrope above suffering, films Clone as a substitute."
"As the characters' seductive power is thus increased, their invisible malady becomes less infectious on the screen because it can be performed: filmed depression appears to bean alien artifice."
We now understand why Auras' books should not be put into the hands of oversensitive readers.
"Let them go see the films and the plays; they will encounter the same malady of distress but subdued, wrapped up in a dreamy charm that softens it and also makes it lore feigned and made up convention."
"Her books, on the contrary, bring us to the verge of madness."
"They do not point toit frown afar, they neither observe it nor analyze it for the sake of experiencing it at a distance in the hope of a solution, like it or not, someday or other..."
"To the contrary, the texts domesticate the malady of death, they fuse with it, are on the same level with it, without either distance or perspective."
"Without Catharsis Lacking recovery or God, having neither value nor beauty other than illness itself seized at the place of its essential rupture, never has art had so lite cathartic potential."
Undoubtedly and for that very reason it falls more within the province of sorcery and bewitchment than within that of grace and forgiveness traditionally associated with artistic genius.
"A complicity with illness emanates frown Auras' texts, a complicity that is corner and at the sale time light because absentminded."
"It leads us to Pray our Kindness, the dangerous rings where identities of meaning, personality, and life collapse. ""the mystery in full daylight"" is how Maurice Barres described Claude Lorraines paintings."
"Inspectorss hero has murdered a woman, as Raskolnikov has (but he re she happens to be his own wife), and then Inlets two others, The Dims a one and a one."
While free hill of the mlurder-assonia does for the prisoner in Crime and neither save nor forgive hün.
"Nevertheless, such an outcome is neither the reverse of forgiveness nor a punishment."
"The inescapable stillness of destiny doses in on the protagonists and bounds the novel with an implacable, perhaps feminine, gentleness, not unlike Auras' disenchanted tone, a truthful Mirror of the sorrow that permeates the subject."
"Death and pain are the spider's web of the text, and woe to the conniving readers who yield to its spell: they night remain there for good."
"The ""crisis in literature"" that Paul V alert, Roger Callous, or Maurice Blanche discussed reaches here a kind of apotheosis."
"Here, the crisis leads writing to remain on the near side of any warping of cleaning, confining itself to baring the malady."
"It is the reverse of dinical discourse-very dose toit, but as it enjoys the illness' secondary benefits cultivates and barnes it without ever exhausting it."
"It displays the same painful, deadly passion (a constant with Auras), conscious of itself and held back (""she might answer that she doesn't love hire."
The whole honduras' work does perhaps not correspond to the ascetic faithfulness to madness that precedes Lamentt.
"Perhaps. ""always their personal his tory, brief as it might be, will prevail over Hiroshima."" But perhaps not."
"For, the comes from Hiroshima, She comes from Nevers where ""she has been read with meanness."" Her first lover was Kennan, he was killed during the Liberation, her hair was shorn."
"Alias "" On the other hand, the horror of Hiroshige somehow liberated her frown her French tragedy."
There~ course to the atonic weapon seels to prove that horror is not invited to one side; it knows neither place nor party but can rage absolutely.
Such a transcendence of horror frees the loving won't of mistaken guilt.
"The young woman henceforth wanders with her ""purposeless love"" all the way to Hiroshima."
"Beyond their wedding, which they terns a happy one, the new love of the two protagonists-although powerful and strikingly authentie-will also be ""strangled"": sheltering a disaster on either side, Nevers here, Hiroshima there."
"However intense it Ina be in its unnameable silence, love is henceforth in suspense, pulverized, atorrlized."
"To love, from her point of view, is to love a dead person."
"The body other new lover nerves with the corpse of her first love, which she had covered with her own body, a day and a night, and whose blood she savored."
But the very dynamic Japanese engineer is also Narked by death because he necessarily bears the moral scars of the atorrlic death of which his countrymen were the first victims.
A love crippled by death or a love of death?
A love that was made impossible or a necrophilic passion for death?
"My love is a Hiroshima, or else, I love Hiroshima for its suffering is my Eros?"
"Hiroshima mon amour preserves that ambiguity, which is, perhaps, the postwar version love."
She can no Ion ger help herself wanting dead as he be.
"Her posture is that of a desiring woman, shameless to the point of crudeness."
"While she does not die as he does, while she outlasts their dead love, she nevertheless becoltles like a dead woman-severed from others and from time, she has the endless, animal stare of cats, she is mad-""having died of love in Nevers."" ""..."
I couldn'tt manage to find the slightest difference between that dead body and nüne...
"Because of that very fact, mourning becomes impossible and changes the heroine into a crypt inhabited by a living corpse..."
"While his tory is unobtrusive and later disappears, it is here cause and setting."
"This drama of love and madness appears to be independent of the political drama as the power of passion outstrips political events, atrocious as they may be."
"What is more, this mad, impossible love seems to triumph over the events-if one may speak of triumph when erotieized suffering or love in suspense hold sway."
"Nevertheless, Auras' melancholia is also like an explosion in history."
Private suffering absorbs political horror into the subjectss psychic microcosm.
"The French woman in Hiroshima might have come out of Stendhal; perhaps she is even eternal and yet she nonetheless exists because of the war, the Nazis, the bomb..."
"Because of its integration into private life, however, political life loses the autonomy that our consciousness persists in setting aside for it, religiously."
"The different participants in the global eonbiet do not disappear, for all that, through a global condemnation that would amount to remission of the crime in the name love."
"The young Kennan is an enemy, the Resistance's severity has its logie, and nothing is said that would justify the Japanese intervention on the side of the Nazis any more than the violence of the belated American counterattack."
"Politics is not, as was for Hannah the field where human n'p,pr!r""""\rri is unfurled."
"The modern the world of world wars, the Third the world of death that acts upon us, do not have the civilized splendor of the Greek city state."
"Hence madness is aspace of antisocial, apolitical, and paradoxically free individuation."
"Up to a point, considering moral suffering, there is no common ground between a shorn lover in France and a Japanese woman scorched by the torn."
"As a result, public life becomes seriously severed from reality whereas private live, on the other hand, is emphasized to the point of filling the whole of the real and invalidating any other concern."
"The new world, necessarily political, is unreal."
We are living the reality of a new suffering world.
"It is possible to imagine a forth of art that, while acknowledging the weight of contemporary suffering, would drown suffering in the conquerors' triumph, or in metaphysical sarcasm's and enthusiasts, or yet in the fondness of erotic pleasure."
"Auras chooses or yields to the appeal of another path-the conniving, voluptuous, bewitching contemplation of death within us, of the wound's constancy."
The struggle of man against death in the face of the Nazi-imposed extermination.
The survivor's struggle in the midst of normalize to recapture for what is dose to a corpse the elemental forces of life.
"One had to deal softly with it, with tact, diplomacy. surrounded him on all sides."
"But there was still one way of reaching him, there was an opening, it was not too wide, through which one could communicate, but life was yet in him, hardly a splinter, but a splinter just the same."
"The heart, we thought, the heart is going to stop."
"Death strikes, as with a battering ram, but the heart is deaf."
"At the heart of her love, her dying love for this man, she yet regains, through and thanks to suffering, her passion for the singular, unique, hence loved forever, being-robert L., the survivor."
"At the mere mention of that name, Robert L., I weep."
I shall weep all my life... during his mortal agony...
"I had known this man, Robert L., best..."
She opened the door and the spittle weighed in her Enough.
"Everyday we try to kill ourselves, to kill."
"We not only don't speak with oneanother, we don't look at oneanother...."
Stein)] or Alissa (destroy] She Said)] to m.ention only three.
"It is a nondram.atic, wilted, unnameable sadness."
A there nothing that produces discreet tears and elliptical words.
"Suffering and rapture flow together somewhat discreetly. ""I love heard it said... her heaven is Invade of tears,"" the vice-consul notes with respect to Annmarie Strutter."
"The peculiar ambassadress to Calcutta seems to wander about with a kind of death buried in her pale, thin body. ""deathin the course of life, the vice-consul finally said, but which would never catchup with you?"
"She is the walking metaphor of a glaucous green Venice, anend-of-the-world city, while for others the city of the Doges remains a source of excitement."
"When she brings together her set of lovers, on the sly at the Blue Moon or at her secret horne, what do they do?"
"She is thin in her black dressing gown, her eyelids are taut, her beauty has vanished."
And suddenly what Charles Rossetti didn't know he was expecting happened.
"Her broad eyelids tremble, the tears do not flow..."
"I weep without any reason that I could explain to you, it is like a sorrow that goes through me, someone has to weep, it's as if it were me."
The unfulfilled mourning of the autosensual preobject determines feminine frigidity.
Hence the pain that goes with it grips a woman unknown to the one who lives on the surface stranger.
"To a narcissism deprived of melancholy appearances, suffering opposes and adds deep narcissism, the archaic autosensuality of wounded affects."
One therefore discovers an unacceptable renunciation at the source of such suffering.
The feeling of unavoidable abandonment that reveals the separation or the actual death of the lovers also seems immanent and as if predestined.
"The mother of the young woman of Nevers was separated from her husband... or else (the The miladyy of, Liras narrator hesitates) she was Jewish, and left for the unoccupied area."
She is the place on the threshold of which silen ce begins.
"What happens there is precisely silence, that slow labor for In entire life."
"I arn still there, before these possessed children, at the same distance from mystery."
"Auras internal madness leads the novelist to love the lither disappear, to free herself from her through a violence no less deadly than that of the mother herself as she beat her prostitute daughter."
"Destroy, the narrating daughter in The Lover seers to say, but in erasing the titherss inge she simultaneously takes her place."
Nothing offered itself that night fin the figure.
"Ushering is sufficient unto itself; it transcends effects as we as causes and sweeps away all entities, that of the subject as wen as of the object."
Would ushering be the ultünate threshold of our objectless states?
"It does not lend itself to description, but it is ac possible through inspirations, tears, blank spaces between words. ""I get carried away over suffering in India."
"It happens to an of us, snore or less, right?"
"She didn't understand why, she would say."
The difficulty she encountered when searching just for one word appeared insurmountable.
"N nevertheless, a few common features of feminine sexuality showup."
"One is led to postulate, in such a being racked by sadness, not repression but an exhaustion of erotic drives."
"Appropriated by the object of lovely the lover or, behind hire, the mother whose mourning remains impossible-the drives are blank, so to speak, emptied of their ability to provide a bond of sexual pleasure or of symbolic complicity."
"Tobe sure, the lost Thing has left its mark on its disused affects and on a discourse relieved of its meaning-but this is the mark of an absence, of a basic disconnection."
It can cause ravishment-but not pleasure.
"If one were to identify that woman and her love one would have to look for her in the secret cellar where there is no one, except for the sparkling eyes of Nevers' cats and the catastrophic anguish of the young woman who merges with them."
"Liras ""shall corner back and go with her?"
That is what The Malady of Death gives us to understand.
"The ran savors the young womans open body like a blissful discovery of the otherwise inaccessible sexual difference, but which nevertheless appears to him as death-bearing, engulfing, dangerous."
"Aloof, unconcerned about sex and yet loving love and compliant to pleasure, she is fond of the death she believes she bears within herself."
"She says, you herald the realm of death."
One cannot love death if it is imposed on you frown outside.
You think you are weeping on account of not loving.
It has its own language-it is called reduplication.
"While what is repeated is rippled out in time, reduplication lies outside time."
"A double ray hold, for a while, the instability of the same, giving it a temporary identity, but it Mainly explores the sale in depth, opening up an unsuspected, unfathomable substance."
Mother and child carry out the crisis of the imaginative thought process in which the identity of a woman is buried in the love for her young.
"Without hire, perhaps, she would bedead."
"With hill, she is caught in the whirlwind love, of practical and educational concerns, but also of solitudes; she is forever exiled roll others and from herself."
"As daily, banal replica of the woman who, at the beginning of the novel, desired to be killed by her lover, Anne Desbaresdes as mother lives her ecstatic death in the love for her son."
The Japanese and the German in Hiroshima Mon Amour The Auras are also doubles.
Reduplication and exchange of complements.
"Through that strange osmosis, the vitality of a survivor of the Hiroshima catastrophe Clones tobe dimmed by a gruesome fate, while the other's definitive death lives on, translucently, in the young womans bruised passion."
"Such a reverberation of her objects of love shatters the heroine's identity: she belongs to no time period but to the space of the contamination of entities where her own being wavers, dejected and delighted."
The Criminal Secret The technique of reduplication reaches its height in The Vice-consul.
"Nevertheless, the contrast between the two fades away when suffering intervenes."
"Against a backdrop of illness the images of the two women merge, and Annmarie Streamerss ethereal universe acquires a measure of madness that would not be as strong without the imprint of the other wanderer."
"Could the Vice-consul be a corrupted, possible metamorphosis of the melancholy ambassadress, her masculine replica, her sadistic variant, the expression of taking action something she precisely does not do, not even through intercourse?"
"He may be homosexual, loving with an impossible love a woman who, in her sexual distress, haunted by desire without satisfaction, would very much have liked to be like him-beyond the law, beyond reach."
"The unbalanced threesome-the bonzian woman, the Vice-consul, the depressed ambassadress weave a world that is beyond the other characters in the novel, even when they are roost attached to the ambassadress."
"They provide the narrator with a rich soil for her psychological search-uncovering the insane, criminal secret that lies beneath the surface of our diplomatic behavior, of which the sadness of a number of women bears discreet witness."
"The act of love is often the occasion for such a reduplication, as each partner becomes the other's double."
"Thus, in The Malady death, the man's death-bearing obsession merges with his mistress' deathful thoughts."
"The tears of the man, as he joys in the womans ""abominable frailty, off~ correspond to her languid, detached silence and reveal its meaning: suffering."
"Stein, Elisabeth Alone, Michael Richardson, Max Thorn, Stein..."
"Event and Hatred: Wrong Women As an echo to death-bearing symbiosis with the mothers, passion between two women represents one of the most intense images of doubling."
Such an of the other meanss passion - Tatiana being here the substitute for the first rival.
"Annmarie and, in the last instance, for the Inother-also works the other way."
"Tatiana, who until then has been careless and playful, begins to suffer."
"The two wom.en are henceforth carbon copies of each other, replicas in the script of suffering, which, in Lot V."
"Elisabeth Alone, who is depressed following an unhappy love affair and the stillbirth of her baby girl, is resting in a bleak hotel, full of sick people."
He loves/they love Alissa and are fascinated by Elisa.
"Hers or Eliass? ""destroy, she said."" The two women, however, get along."
"Elisabeth doesn't answer. ""we knew each other when we were kids, she says."
"Our families were on good terms. "" Alissa repeats in a very low voice: ""we knew each other when we were kids."
"Max Thor is in love with his wife Alissa, but since he has not forgotten that he is Stein's double he calls her Elisa in his dreams, while Stein horns elf dreams and speaks Alissas nance..."
That is enough to unbalance each protagonist and hollow out even more her unsettled identity.
What are the ingredients of such a rrlixture of hypnosis and utopia passion?
The screen of hatred therefore is not sounded in its wild brutality.
"When expresses itself, it becom.es criticized as destruction-unleashed violence with the Another, graceful tearing downwith the friend."
"So lunch resentment, year after year, day after day."
"Suzanne, at her feet, half naked in her torn dress, was crying...."
"And that incestuous desire that the brother shares in and carries out in his own furious and nearly delinquent fashion (""..."
"All the figures of love converge on this autost'nsual, harrowing object, even if they are constantly revived by the mainspring of a masculine present'."
"Both sensuous and abstract, they are undermined by a fear that their passion never succeeds in overconüng."
"She relates the psychic substratum previous to our conquests of the other sex, and which still underlies the eventual, The."
Auras encounters between lien and worsen.
One is aeeustorned to pay no attention to uterine space. one is not wrong.
"For in that fun of refleeloennxles, bonds, and feelings destroy one 'l."".,t-t-l"""".... ""destroy, she said."" And the society of worsen is neither necessarily wild nor simply destructive."
"Values do not hold in the face of that ""irony of the community"" (as Hegel called women), whose destructiveness, however, is not necessarily amusing."
Suffering unfurls its microcosm through the reverberation of characters.
"They are articulated as doubles, as in mirrors that magnify their melancholia to the point of violence and delirium."
"That display of reduplication recalls the childs unstable identity when, in the mirror, it finds the image of its mother only as a (soothing or terrifying) replica or echo of itself."
"Like an alter ego that has been frozen within the gamut of drive intensities that disturb it, detached in front of it, but never steady and on the brink of invading it through a hostile return, like a boomerang."
Even the soundest among us know just the sarre that a firm identity remains a fiction.
"Suffering, in Auras' work, in a mannered way and with empty words evokes that irrlpossible ltiourning, which, if its process had been completed, would have removed our morbid lining and set us The Malady Auras upas independent, unified subjects."
"Thus it takes hold of us and carries us to the dangerous, furtherm.ost bounds of our psychic life."
"Modern and Postmodern As the literature of our illness, Auras' fiction accompanies the distress that has certainly been triggered and increased by the contemporary world but proves to be essential and transhistorical."
"Coupled with rhetorical awkwardness, they nuke up a world of unsettling, infectious iil-being."
"The desire for comedy shows up today to conceal-without for that natter being unaware of tithe concern for such a truth without tragedy, melancholia Without purgatory."
A new adulatory world comes to the surface within the eternal return of historical and intellectual cycles.
"Following the winter of discontent comes the artifice of secerning; following the whiteness ofboredorrl, the heartrending distraction of parody."
"Truth, in short, makes its way amid the shimmering of artificial amenities as well as asserting itself in painful mirror barnes."
